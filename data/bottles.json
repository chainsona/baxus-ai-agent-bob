    "description": "On Sunday evening April 2 2006 a severe storm with tornado strength winds tore through Central Kentucky damaging two Buffalo Trace Distillery aging warehouses. One of the damaged warehouses was Warehouse C a treasured warehouse on property built by Colonel Edmund Haynes Taylor Jr. in 1885. It sustained significant damage to its roof and north brick wall exposing a group of aging bourbon barrels to the elements. That summer the exposed barrels waited patiently while the roof and walls were repaired meanwhile being exposed to the Central Kentucky climate. When these barrels were tasted years later it was discovered that the sun wind and elements they had experienced created a bourbon rich in flavors that was unmatched. This was truly a special batch of barrels and though the Distillery does not hope for another tornado it feels lucky to have been able to release this once in a lifetime product.",

Born in 1830 he was orphaned at the age of five and was adopted by his uncle Edmund Haynes Taylor Snr who rechristened him as his junior. E.H. Taylor Jr is also referred to as Colonel Taylor due to his holding of the honourary title of Kentucky Colonel something he shares with a number of state's distinguished sons most notably a certain fried chicken vendor. Throughout his career Taylor set up and owned seven different distilleries and his lobbying for the Bottled in Bond Act of 1897 has seen him considered as the father of modern bourbon. Ten years earlier having sold his stake in the OFC distillery (now Buffalo Trace) to George T. Stagg he set up the Old Taylor distillery near Frankfort in Kentucky. The distillery featured a faux-Castle and sunken gardens on-site and was the birthplace of bourbon tourism. Here he established the Old Taylor brand which following Prohibition passed into the hands of National Distillers one of the big four distilling company's who dominated the post-repeal market. The distillery itself closed in 1972 but production was moved to the neighbouring Old Grand-dad site until National Distillers were acquired by Jim Beam in 1987 who converted it into a warehousing and bottling facility. Beam marketed the brand alongside the other Olds from the National Distiller portfolio (Old Crow and Old Grand-dad) until 2009 when the Sazerac Company acquired it returning Taylor's name to his early spiritual home at Buffalo Trace.

    "description": "The Wild Turkey Rare Breed from the late 1990s and early 2000s, particularly batches like the renowned W-T-01-99, represents a pinnacle in bourbon craftsmanship that many enthusiasts consider legendary. These expressions, bottled at barrel proof (typically around 108.4 proof), showcase the distillery's commitment to producing complex, full-flavored whiskeys during a time when the bourbon industry was experiencing a glut of aged stocks. This era of Rare Breed is particularly prized for its rich, multifaceted flavor profile that balances intensity with elegance.\n\nTasting notes for these vintage Rare Breed releases often describe a dense, classic Wild Turkey profile with remarkable depth. The nose typically offers a fragrant bouquet of brandy-like fruitiness, honey-maple sweetness, and medicinal cherry, complemented by caramel creme, sweet oak, and herbal-floral spices. On the palate, enthusiasts report an oily mouthfeel delivering waves of cherry-vanilla, butter toffee, and brown sugar, intertwined with sweet herbs, citrus notes, and warm baking spices. The finish is characteristically long and flavorful, leaving a lasting impression of vanilla bean, cola, and molasses. These batches are often cited as being superior to modern releases, showcasing a perfect harmony of aged stocks that's difficult to replicate in today's high-demand bourbon market.\n",

    "description": "Blanton's Takara Red is a special edition of the celebrated Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon, exclusively released for the Japanese market. Part of the Takara series, which also includes Takara Black and Takara Gold, this expression is highly sought after by bourbon enthusiasts and collectors around the world.\n\nTakara Red is distinguished by its unique characteristics, including an aging process that is rumored to be a minimum of eight years, although this is not officially confirmed on the label. It is bottled at 93 proof (46.5% ABV), the same as the standard Blanton's Single Barrel, ensuring a robust flavor profile.\n\nThe packaging of Takara Red adds to its allure, featuring a distinctive red box with a woven texture and a deep maroon bag that contrasts with the brown bag of domestic Blanton's. The bottle is adorned with a gold-colored wax seal, similar to that found on Blanton's Straight From The Barrel. The label showcases light brown handwritten and printed portions, along with Japanese script spelling out \"Whiskey,\" further emphasizing its exclusivity.\n\nThe Takara Red series is particularly interesting for collectors due to its limited availability and the variations that can arise from individual barrel selections. Some special releases within this series, such as the HBA (Hotel Barmen Association Japan) Single Barrel picks, offer even more unique expressions.\n\nWhile many enthusiasts speculate about the potential superiority of the Takara series due to its rumored longer aging process, recent reviews suggest that modern releases may be more comparable in quality to standard Blanton's. Nevertheless, Takara Red remains a highly coveted expression in the bourbon world, often commanding premium prices on the secondary market.",

This bottling is marked as pre prohibition suggesting the spirit was distilled prior to the enactment of prohibition. Dating details for this bottle are somewhat slim but Wagner left their Dock Street address in 1947, so this bottle pre-dates 1947. The note about prohibition suggests it was bottled after prohibition was lifted, so circa 1930. This was likely blended from a variety of Jamaican estate producers. Wagner were primarily importers of tea products but also handled wine & spirits, with the firm reportedly selling booze illegally during prohibition. They notably also imported a VSO Scotch whisky blend from Mackinlay (owners of Glen Mhor), so VSO is likely a brand they gave to products blended for them.",

We came up with the idea of blending a bourbon to celebrate the New Year and gave ourselves free rein to develop something to capture the spirit of the season. It was the first time we blended barrels of different ages with different mashbills from different states and we had a lot of fun doing it. To date, every bourbon release has been a marriage of casks produced in the same distillation season. We do this to highlight different production styles aging techniques and age expressions. To commemorate 2017, we combined 5 to 13-year-old barrels from several different states which were distilled and aged using different techniques. We had one goal: to make the most captivating  delicious bourbon we could.\"",

    "name": "Old Rip Van Winkle 7 Year Bay Colony Bicentennial Decanter 1975 Release",
    "description": "This is an incredible piece of bourbon history. Following the forced sale of Stitzel-Weller distillery by the Van Winkle family in 1972  Julian II (son of the legendary 'Pappy') was granted an office and a license to continue procuring and bottling Stitzel-Weller stock on site as a gesture of goodwill by new distillery owners  Somerset Imports. Although Julian had sold the distillery and all of its brands, he retained one: the pre-prohibition Van Winkle label, which he immediately revived. The earliest releases from the Van Winkle brand were decanters like this. Bottled in 1975 at 7 years old, the Stitzel-Weller whiskey it contains would have been barrelled at the distillery while Julian II was still in charge. While Van Winkle was generally always bottled using Stitzel-Weller stock procured from its new owners, there aren't many like this that contain Van Winkle-era Stitzel-Weller whiskey. Following the death of Julian II, his son, Julian III took over the family business and moved bottling to Old Commonwealth distillery in 1983. With Stitzel-Weller's closure by United Distillers in 1992 causing his stocks to begin thinning out  Van Winkle reached an agreement with the Sazerac company to store and bottle his remaining stock. He also entrusted the production of new Van Winkle whiskey to their Buffalo Trace distillery, which was already using the familiar recipe to produce W.L. Weller, another former Stitzel-Weller brand. The Van Winkle brand we are familiar with today has been produced at Buffalo Trace since 2002. This -- a Van Winkle-era Stitzel-Weller bourbon bottled for the Van Winkle brand -- is a true collector's item. The decanter itself is a celebration of the Bay Colony bicentennial in 1975  and was produced by Cumberland Porcelain.",

    "description": "Barrel #767775 is a BAXUS-exclusive family reserve high-rye bourbon from the Wilderness Trail distillery, bottled at cask strength of 58.5% ABV. This barrel was selected at the distillery by members of the BAXUS team, as well as two community members chosen to join the trip based on the bottles of bourbon they had listed in their collections on the app. The legendary whiskey writer David Tao also participated in selecting this bourbon, which was chosen from among seven other options as the most outstanding of the lot. This particularly small barrel yielded only 144 bottles, rather than the standard 200, further highlighting its concentrated flavor profile. It was matured for 5 years in an ISC Classic #4 charred barrel and fermented with yeast strain 927.\n\nWilderness Trail is one of the most innovative distilleries in the world, particularly renowned for its focus on yeast due to its long history as fermentation experts. In 2006, Dr. Pat Heist and Shane Baker founded FermSolutions, a consulting firm that created unique yeast strains and provided technical assistance to distilleries and breweries across the United States. After seven years, the firm had established itself so well in Kentucky distilling circles that Heist and Baker decided to set up their own distillery.\n\nWilderness Trail Distillery was built in 2013 in Danville, initially using a pot still before expanding twice to ramp up production. The founders initially focused on contract distillation for other brands but later began producing barrels for themselves, with varying mash bills, including a high-rye, wheated, and traditional rye mash bill. Their industry-leading experience in fermentation innovation means the yeast strain used for each mash is just as important as the grains or stills used. Whiskey is fundamentally made of water, yeast, and grain, with most modern distillers primarily adjusting the grain to create new products. Wilderness Trail's fundamentally scientific approach means these different yeast strains can create various types of spirits using the same mash bill, with one potentially being fruit-forward while another is heavier and earthier in character.\n\nTypically choosing to release their spirits around the 4- to 6-year mark, their expertise in all aspects of production has allowed them to create a flavor-first style of whiskey at a relatively young age. This innovative brilliance caught the eye of the large Italian drinks company Campari, which purchased a 70% stake in Wilderness Trail in October 2022, with the final 30% to be purchased in 2031. The deal was reportedly valued at $420 million, signifying just how valuable the new Kentucky producer has become in the market.",

From its launch in 1989 to commemorate the 60th Anniversary of Suntory, Hibiki embodies the Suntory philosophy to live in harmony with nature and people. As the Founding House of Japanese Whisky and A House of Master Blenders, the House of Suntory has gone to great lengths to explore the breadth and depth of what Harmony can mean for a blend. Every Hibiki expression is one of the most sought after blends in the world where every Hibiki expression is meticulously crafted for us to discover a different kind of Harmony. Achieving the right balance and orchestration proved to be a great challenge from the start since the Sakura cask is one with strong character that can easily become overbearing. \n\nAfter much trial and error, we found that the grain whiskies finished in the Sakura cask best elevated the overall balance as a Blossoming Harmony slowly unfolding. The end result is a particularly unique expression of Hibiki. The invitation of an enticing floral bouquet, followed by the signature Hibiki depth and complexity of honey, candied orange peel, jasmine and chocolatey decadence, all climaxing to a surprising finish of bitter sweet spicy notes.\"",

    "description": "Weller Special Reserve is a Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey produced by Buffalo Trace Distillery, known for its smooth and approachable character. This wheated bourbon, crafted using Buffalo Trace's wheated mashbill, is bottled at 90 proof (45% ABV). On the nose, it offers inviting aromas of vanilla, caramel, and a hint of dried fruit. The palate presents a harmonious blend of honey, butterscotch, and soft woodiness, complemented by subtle notes of cinnamon and citrus.\n\nAs the entry-level offering in the Weller lineup, Special Reserve delivers a sweet and mellow drinking experience that appeals to both bourbon enthusiasts and newcomers alike. Its softer flavor profile, attributed to the use of wheat instead of rye in the mashbill, makes it versatile for sipping neat or as a base for cocktails. While it has become increasingly difficult to find due to high demand, Weller Special Reserve remains an excellent value at its suggested retail price, offering a quality bourbon experience that showcases the appealing characteristics of wheated bourbons. Despite its growing scarcity, it continues to be appreciated for its smooth taste and well-balanced flavor, making it a sought-after bottle in the world of American whiskey.",

Upon his return to the Glenfiddich distillery Brian started experimenting with several French oak icewine casks from the Canadian winery, filling them with different Glenfiddich aged malts for up to six months.

Originating from barrel #288, situated in Warehouse H, Rick 48, and decanted on July 1, 1991, this bourbon displays a proof of 93, indicating an alcohol content of 46.5%.\n\nUpon olfactory examination, this bourbon presents a delightful trio of aromas, encompassing caramel, brown sugar, and sweet herbs, forming a sweet and inviting nose that beckons the taster.\n\nTransitioning to the palate, it initially unveils a sweet landscape dominated by the richness of brown sugar complemented by a hint of maple syrup. As the tasting journey progresses, a notable transition occurs, ushering in a spicier profile mid-palate, which adds a contrasting yet harmonious layer to the tasting experience.\n\nAlthough the review does not correspond to the specific barrel number H-48 288, it sheds light on the meticulous craftsmanship and the quality of flavors one might anticipate from a Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon of the early 1990s era. This vintage bourbon, with its blend of sweet and spicy notes, embodies the timeless and cherished characteristics associated with Blanton's bourbon lineage.",

A little water releases more volatile top notes, like pine resin, vetiver root, coriander, liquorice and a curious soapy note.\nTASTE\nThe texture is soft, ‘sappy’, gently coating the tongue. The explosion of firm robust flavours is unquestionably Ardbeg – coal tar soap, aniseed, peppermint, espresso coffee, sweet barley malt and a lingering, aromatic smokiness.\nFINISH\nThe lingering finish is both fresh with menthol and spicy, with hints of allspice, clove and bitter almonds, finally revealing a distant vanilla essence sweetness.",

    "description": "This 10 year old single barrel bourbon from Willett was crafted from a mashbill of 72% corn, 13% rye and 15% malted barley. It was matured in warehouse A on the 4th floor and was bottled at 65.8% Abv exclusively for LeNell's. \n\nA legendary name in the bourbon industry, LeNell's was founded by LeNell Camacho Santa Ana. Now a true industry icon, LeNell opened her first store in 2003 in Brooklyn and rapidly built the location into a premier American whiskey destination. She frequently collaborated with brands on special releases for the store and throughout her six year period of operating in Brooklyn, she established LeNell's as one of the greatest liquor stores on the planet. It was through her collaboration with KBD, otherwise known as Willett, that she would establish her own brand of rye whiskey called Red Hook Rye. This mature rye whiskey was sourced from Willett who held an extremely deep archive of well matured American whiskies.\n\nWillett had stopped distilling themselves in the 1980s amid a serious downturn in the market, instead pivoting to being a bottler of other distillery's products. This meant that they had slowly established a serious collection of barrels from various distilleries across Kentucky who were either closing amid the industry downturn, or rapidly scrambling to sell barrels at very low prices.\n\nLeNell contacted KBD and the company was more than happy to provide very old barrels of rye whiskey for her Red Hook Rye brand. She chose barrels that were 23 & 24 years of age, a set of ages that are unheard of in rye whiskey. This series of bottlings has become mythic amongst whiskey collectors and routinely breaks auction records each time one is unearthed. It is heralded as the greatest rye, if not the greatest American whiskey, ever produced. ",

On the palate, it presents honey-like sweetness, candied orange peel, and white chocolate, leading to a subtle, tender, and long finish with hints of Mizunara (Japanese oak). The bottle design is inspired by a traditional kimono pattern and is embellished with the tabane-noshi, a traditional Japanese symbol of celebration, reflecting the brand's dedication to craftsmanship and the celebration of life's special moments.",

It aged for 13 years before being transferred to a holding tank, where it waited for over a decade for a special occasion. The result is a bourbon that offers a glimpse into the distillery's past while showcasing the exceptional quality of well-aged wheated bourbon.\n\nOn the nose, this Old Fitzgerald presents a rich bouquet of aromas, including aged wood varnish, leather, vanilla frosting, and toasted coconut. There are also hints of brown sugar, salted nuts, and melted rum raisin ice cream, creating a complex and inviting olfactory experience.\n\nThe palate delivers a harmonious blend of flavors, with prominent notes of seasoned oak and leather that speak to its extended aging. Vanilla, coffee, and chocolate notes mingle with fruity undertones of cherry, spiced baked apples, and sweetened dried apricots. Notably, the heat is more subdued compared to younger Old Fitzgerald releases, allowing the nuanced flavors to shine.\n\nThe finish is remarkably long and oak-forward, with additional notes of scorched caramel, subtle almond, and drying leather. Despite the robust oak presence, the bourbon maintains a balance that prevents it from becoming overly bitter.\n\nThis limited edition Old Fitzgerald, bottled at 100 proof as per Bottled in Bond requirements, is exclusively available at the Heaven Hill Bourbon Experience in Bardstown, Kentucky. Its unique provenance and exceptional flavor profile make it a highly sought-after release for bourbon enthusiasts and collectors alike.\n",

    "description": "Whiskey JYPSI Legacy Batch 002: \"The Alchemist\" is an innovative and complex expression that showcases the brand's commitment to pushing the boundaries of whiskey blending. This limited release, co-founded by country music star Eric Church, is a meticulously crafted blend of rare whiskeys from three different countries.\n\nOn the nose, \"The Alchemist\" offers an enticing bouquet of aromas, featuring notes of plums, vanilla, and cinnamon, complemented by subtle hints of pear and oak. This complex scent profile sets the stage for an equally intricate tasting experience.\n\nThe palate delivers a harmonious blend of flavors, featuring an interplay of black pepper, sweet crème brûlée, plum, cinnamon, raspberry, and tobacco. The influence of the triple-barrel finish on the Canadian rye component is evident, adding layers of dark fruit and subtle tannins that enhance the whiskey's depth and complexity. Despite its high proof of 114.3, the mouthfeel is remarkably smooth.\n\nThis unique blend consists of:\n- 60% 11-year-old Tennessee corn whiskey aged in re-charred American oak barrels\n- 36% 18+ year-old Canadian rye, finished in port, sherry, and vermouth casks\n- 4% 10-year-old Indian single malt\n\nThe finish is long and satisfying, with the fruity notes gradually giving way to more pronounced pepper, cinnamon, and a hint of peppermint. Lingering flavors of oak, tobacco, and leather provide a complex conclusion to each sip.\n\n",

    "description": "Sazerac 18 Year has certainly gone through some growing pains since the last of the legendary “steel tanked batch” dried up in 2015. It was hard to say goodbye, but it has allowed the brand to ebb and flow more than it was ever allowed to in the past. The result has seen Sazerac 18 Year reach its arguably lowest point ever, and even when it seemed like it might be reaching for past graces, it fell short there too. While the brand certainly deserves all of the time it needs to find its new groove, every year, there’s wishful hoping that this is the year Sazerac 18 Year comes roaring back. In many ways, Sazerac 18 Year finds its best footing since 2016. The nose is wonderfully expressive, instantly transporting me back to the steel tanked years. This is largely due to the whiskey returning to the classic Sazerac 18 Year profile. There aren’t any hard left turns here, which will satisfy diehards of the old batch and newcomers hoping to taste what all the fuss was about. If it wasn’t for its astringent finish, this rye would be firing on all fronts. Perhaps it spent too much time in the barrel (this year’s release was aged for an extra 6 months). Despite that, it is Sazerac 18 Year’s best showing post steel tanked batch. There is a lot to really enjoy here, but for a brand that used to go toe to toe with Van Winkle Family Reserve Rye, it still has some working out to do before it’s back in its old fighting form again. That said, the elements are all present: classic rich nose and an elegant flavor profile with pitch perfect balance. If Buffalo Trace is able to further dial this in a few more notches, the Saz will finally have its groove back.\n\n",

    "description": "William Larue Weller was born into a distilling family in Kentucky in 1825  and launched his W.L. Weller brand in 1849. Originally a rectification business (creating 'whiskey' using neutral spirit  colouring and flavourings)  this all changed with the Bottled in Bond Act of 1897 and the death of Weller two years later. The company was left in the hands of the fiercely passionate Julian 'Pappy' Van Winkle I who having steered it safely through the wreckage of National Prohibition  established Old Weller alongside the newly acquired Old Fitzgerald labels and the flagship brands for the new Stitzel-Weller distillery in 1933. It was produced there for over 60 years  eventually being sold to the Sazerac Company in 1999  who distil it at Buffalo Trace using Pappy's recipe to this day. This is a 1978 bottling of the 7 year old Original 107 Proof wheated bourbon. This was produced by United Distillers at Stitzel-Weller  although by this point it had been renamed by its previous owners after flagship brand  Old Fitzgerald. The Stitzel-Weller company was officially established in 1933 at the repeal of National Prohibition in the US. It was the result of a merger between the A. Ph. Stitzel distillery and its biggest customer  W.L. Weller & Sons. The Stitzel-Weller distillery opened on Kentucky Derby day in 1935  and quickly developed a reputation for its high quality wheated bourbon  and its main brands were Old Weller  Old Fitzgerald and Cabin Still. The original ownership was shared between Alex T. Farnsley  Arthur Philip Stitzel and Julian Van Winkle. The former passed-away in 1941 and 1947  respectively  leaving the Van Winkle family as the sole heirs to the business. 'Pappy' died in 1965  having handed the reigns to his son  Julian II the year prior  who ran it until 1972 when the board of directors forced him to sell it to the Norton-Simon subsidiary  Somerset Imports. When they were bought over by the American arm of Scottish distillers  DCL  its subsequent iteration invested heavily in bourbon. So much so in fact  that their newly rebuilt Bernheim distillery had such capacity that Stitzel-Weller was rendered surplus to requirements. It was shut down in 1992. Still part of the Diageo portfolio  it has never re-opened and instead now houses the visitor experience for their Bulleit brand.",

They sold the distillery to Murray McDavid in 2001, who launched the peated Port Charlotte and heavily-peated Octomore single malts in 2006 and 2008. A recommissioned Lomond still also now produces the popular Botanist gin there.This whisky was distilled in October 1990.

These flavors are beautifully complemented by rich chocolate notes, creating a harmonious blend of fruit, sweetness, and depth.\n\nThis First Edition release is a marriage of ex-bourbon casks, Oloroso Sherry, and red wine barrels, showcasing Tenmile's commitment to innovative cask management. The diverse barrel influences contribute to the whiskey's complexity and depth of flavor.\n\nTenmile Distillery's approach, which combines traditional Scottish whisky-making methods with American innovation, is evident in Little Rest. The involvement of Shane Fraser, who previously distilled for renowned Scottish distilleries, brings a wealth of experience to this American Single Malt.\n\nLittle Rest represents a promising start for Tenmile Distillery, offering a well-crafted and nuanced American Single Malt that should appeal to both seasoned whiskey enthusiasts and those new to the category[1].\n",

Fresh honeysuckle and nougat aromas, sugared almonds, sponge cake, icing sugar. Expressive and exciting. PALATE Smooth as a snooker ball, with delicious fresh grain, oak tannins and delicately sherried malt. Some clove, pepper and mixed peel as the sherry comes forward. The citrus is here as well, if slightly more tart like lemon or grapefruit. FINISH Spices, apple peel and the last remnants of the finely-tuned grain. Nothing dominates, everything in place - the integration and balance are quite remarkable. The spices seem to build in intensity at the finale.

This smaller bottle size, often referred to as a \"half-pint\" or \"flask\" size, offers a compact yet potent representation of Wild Turkey's craftsmanship during this period.\n\nTypically bottled at the iconic 101 proof (50.5% ABV), this 375ml Wild Turkey from the 1980s showcases the rich, robust flavor profile that the brand became renowned for under Master Distiller Jimmy Russell's guidance. The nose likely presents a harmonious blend of classic bourbon notes - vanilla, caramel, and oak - complemented by the signature Wild Turkey spice and hints of leather and tobacco. On the palate, enthusiasts might expect a full-bodied experience with flavors of butterscotch, dark fruits, and a pronounced spiciness characteristic of Wild Turkey's high-rye mashbill. The finish would likely be long and warming, with lingering notes of oak, vanilla, and a touch of medicinal cherry - a hallmark of Wild Turkey from this era. While the 375ml size might be smaller, it doesn't diminish the complexity and depth of the bourbon inside. These bottles are particularly prized by collectors not only for their compact size but also as representations of Wild Turkey's quality during a time when aged stocks were plentiful and the bourbon industry was on the cusp of significant changes.\n",

This whiskey is a blend of various Four Roses recipes, with 80% of the bourbon aged a minimum of 8 years and 20% aged 10 years or greater. It is bottled at 86 proof (43% ABV) and is known for its light copper color and a flavor profile that includes floral and sweet notes, vanilla, and a touch of oak. The finish is described as starting light and sweet with honey and vanilla, then transitioning to a drier side with aged oak and leather, along with a dash of white pepper. The Four Roses Super Premium is sometimes referred to as Four Roses \"Platinum\" due to the color of the embossed roses on the bottle, which are made of light metal. This bourbon is a product of the Kirin Brewery Company, which acquired the Four Roses brand trademark from Diageo in February 2002. While it is a Japan-only bourbon, it is bottled at 750ml, unlike many other export-only bourbons, including Four Roses Black Label, which are typically bottled at 700ml. The Four Roses Super Premium is a unique novelty for bourbon enthusiasts and a must-have for diehard Four Roses fans looking to complete their collection.",

This special release is the result of a collaboration between Kentucky Owl's Master Blender John Rhea and Irish Whiskey Bonder Louise McGuane.\n\nOn the nose, this bourbon offers an inviting bouquet of aromas. Sweet notes of caramel and honey are prominent, balanced by just enough spice to tease the palate. There's also a subtle hint of fruit, adding complexity to the overall scent profile.\n\nThe palate delivers a harmonious blend of flavors. Long notes of caramel, butterscotch, and frosted cinnamon roll form the foundation, complemented by hints of chocolate and orange. A touch of candy floss and citrus peel adds brightness, while bright forest fruit notes emerge on the mid-palate. The blend showcases the best of both worlds - the rich caramel and vanilla notes from rare older bourbons, spice and fruit from higher rye bourbons, and sweetness and citrus from wheated bourbons.\n\nThe finish is long and satisfying, with lingering notes of vanilla pod and a balanced wood influence. There's also a subtle hint of nutmeg and clove spice, adding depth to the conclusion.\n\nThis St. Patrick's Edition features Kentucky straight bourbons aged 4 to 11 years, carefully selected and blended to create a robust, well-balanced bourbon experience. It successfully marries the bold, spicy character of Kentucky bourbon with the fruit-forward profiles beloved in Irish whiskey, resulting in a unique and enjoyable expression that appeals to enthusiasts of both styles.\n",

From the cooler, more humid conditions of the first floor to the warmer, drier atmospheres of the higher floors, each barrel contributes distinct nuances to the final blend.\n\nTo honor the individuality of each batch, the Ben Holladay Bourbon label showcases a blending chart, guiding consumers through the intricate blending process and enabling them to discern the unique characteristics of each expression.

This expression serves as a tribute to those vanished barrels and the opportunities lost during that tumultuous time.\n\nOn the nose, Confiscated offers an enticing bouquet of aromas. Notes of gardenia and banana bread provide a sweet, floral introduction, complemented by the toasty scent of sourdough bread crust. There's also a hint of red apple, adding a touch of fruity freshness to the overall aroma profile.\n\nThe palate delivers a harmonious blend of flavors. Initial notes of graham crackers and citrus give way to rich toffee and a muted sweet cinnamon spice. These flavors are beautifully balanced with white grape notes, creating a complex and satisfying taste experience. \n\nThe finish is long and warming, with a subtle hint of cayenne pepper adding a gentle spicy kick to the conclusion. This final note of heat provides an interesting contrast to the sweeter elements present throughout the sip.\n\nKentucky Owl Confiscated is a full-flavored and full-bodied bourbon that offers a rich drinking experience. It successfully captures the spirit of its historical inspiration while delivering a thoroughly modern and enjoyable bourbon. This expression would appeal to both bourbon enthusiasts and those interested in the storied history of American whiskey.\n",

The nose is really fantastic, with no signs of 107 proof heat.  On the palate, Baker’s delivers sweet butterscotch and light oak. Again, like the nose, any proof heat on the palate is hidden. A little bit of chewing evokes raw peanut and toffee in the form of peanut brittle. There’s also the note of a chalky pink bubblegum stick, like from the old Topps baseball cards.

This 12 year old bourbon is bottled at their signature 101 proof and lasted until 1992 when it was changed to a split label. Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107.

    "description": "Michter's US*1 Single Barrel Straight Rye Whiskey is a highly regarded expression that showcases the distillery's commitment to quality and craftsmanship. This rye whiskey is made from select American rye grain that is sheared to maximize flavor absorption during fermentation and aged in a heated warehouse.\n\nOn the nose, Michter's Rye offers an inviting bouquet of aromas. Sweet notes of caramel and vanilla are complemented by subtle floral touches, creating a complex and enticing scent. There's also a hint of coconut that adds an intriguing dimension to the aroma profile.\n\nThe palate delivers a harmonious blend of flavors. Initial waves of vanilla and caramel give way to more complex notes of black pepper, marmalade, and plum. The rye's signature spiciness is present but well-balanced, offering a gentle warmth rather than an overwhelming heat. Light hints of coconut and baking spices add depth and complexity to the overall flavor profile.\n\nThe finish is long and satisfying, with lingering notes of spicy grain and light caramel. There's a pleasant interplay between the sweetness and the rye spice, creating a balanced and enjoyable conclusion to each sip.\n\nMichter's Rye has garnered critical acclaim, with The Tasting Panel awarding it an impressive 99 points. They praised its \"cinnamon-covered butterscotch candy\" character and noted subtle background notes of summer peach and apricot nectar.\n\nThis whiskey exemplifies Michter's dedication to producing premium rye, offering a rich and nuanced drinking experience that appeals to both rye enthusiasts and those new to the category. Its balance of sweetness and spice makes it versatile enough to enjoy neat, on the rocks, or as a premium base for cocktails.\n\n",

This unique rye whiskey undergoes a double oak aging process, resulting in a complex and richly flavored spirit.\n\nOn the nose, Blue Run Double Oak Rye offers a captivating blend of aromas. Initial notes of cinnamon and nutmeg are complemented by hints of vanilla and caramel, likely enhanced by the second oak aging. There's also a subtle undercurrent of fresh fruit, perhaps apple or pear, adding depth to the bouquet.\n\nThe palate delivers a harmonious balance of spice and sweetness. The signature rye spiciness is present with notes of black pepper and clove, but it's tempered by the additional oak influence. Flavors of toasted oak, dark chocolate, and maple syrup intermingle, creating a rich and full-bodied mouthfeel. The double oaking process imparts a noticeable layer of complexity, with hints of char and subtle tannins enhancing the overall flavor profile.\n\nThe finish is long and warming, with lingering notes of baking spices, oak, and a touch of dark fruit. There's a pleasant interplay between the spicy rye character and the sweet, oaky notes from the second barrel, creating a satisfying conclusion to each sip.\n\nBlue Run Double Oak Rye exemplifies the distillery's innovative approach, appealing to both rye enthusiasts and those seeking new flavor experiences in their whiskey.",

Bottled at a formidable 134.8 proof (67.4% ABV), this uncut and unfiltered bourbon showcases the intense flavors developed through aging in the extreme Texas climate.\n\nMaster Distiller Donnis Todd handpicks the barrels for Cowboy Bourbon from his \"piggy bank\" of exceptional casks that are deemed too flavorful to bottle immediately. These barrels, aged for at least 6 years, are further matured in the harsh Texas heat, resulting in a bourbon of remarkable depth and complexity.\n\nOn the nose, this Cowboy Bourbon offers a powerful bouquet of aromas, including rich maple syrup, cinnamon, leather, and robust oak notes. The palate delivers an intense flavor explosion, with initial waves of heat giving way to a complex interplay of flavors. Expect bold notes of campfire smoke, dark maple candy, leather, and cinnamon, underpinned by a strong oak presence.\n\nThe finish is exceptionally long and warming, with lingering notes of wintergreen, leather, and oak, complemented by a subtle sweetness reminiscent of maple candy. Despite its high proof, this bourbon maintains a surprising balance, with the intense flavors standing up to and complementing the alcohol heat.\n\n",

    "description": "Booker's 2021-02 \"Tagalong Batch\" is a distinctive release in the renowned Booker's Bourbon lineup, paying homage to the tradition of knowledge passing between generations at the Jim Beam distillery. This small batch bourbon was aged for 6 years, 5 months, and 0 days before being bottled at a robust 127.9 proof (63.95% ABV).\n\nOn the nose, this expression offers pronounced aromas of caramel and vanilla, balanced with \"sweet brown\" wood sugar notes from the charred white oak barrels. The palate delivers a bold flavor profile characteristic of Booker's, featuring rich notes of vanilla, caramel, and toasted nuts, complemented by a subtle spiciness from the high rye content in the mash bill.\n\nThe batch is composed of barrels from three production dates, aged in six different rackhouse locations. This careful selection process contributes to the whiskey's complexity and depth of flavor. The deep, rich color comes from the mid-to-high rackhouse floor locations where these barrels matured.\n\nDespite its high proof, Tagalong Batch is described as having a surprisingly clean finish, inviting the drinker back for another sip. This release exemplifies the Booker's tradition of uncut, unfiltered bourbon that showcases the full flavor and character of the distillate.\n\nNamed to celebrate how Booker Noe learned the craft by \"tagging along\" with his grandfather Jim Beam at the distillery, this batch embodies the legacy and expertise passed down through generations of master distillers at Jim Beam.\n",

    "description": "Situated on a ridge above the banks of the River Spey the Easter Elchies House has been the spiritual home of The Macallan for over three centuries. In 1820 Alexander Reid began renting the home from Sir Lewis Grant. Reid was a farmer and soon after he sowed the fields surrounding the home with barley Reid established the first licensed distillery on the estate which he named Macallan after an ancient church that had been destroyed by fire during the 15th century. In the winter when there was little activity on the farm Reid would ferment and distill his excess grains into whisky which was often drunk straight from the still or sold to travelers passing through the town. Today the Macallan Estate encompasses 370 acres 95 of which are devoted to the production of the Macallan Estate's Minstrel barley (a single acre produces about 2.5 tons of barley each year enough to yield 1800 bottles of The Macallan). In addition the distillery contracts with farmers to purchase barley that is low in nitrogen and high in starch resulting in a rich and oily whisky. After the barley is harvested in late August and early September it is malted before being mashed in one of The Macallan's two mash tuns a process that takes between four and eight hours. Then the barley is fermented with a specially cultured yeast before being distilled twice through copper-pot stills. The copper comprising the stills acts as a catalyst and enhances the formation of sweet esters while minimizing impurities such as sulphur. In addition the curiously small stills some of the smallest stills within the Scotch whisky industryaccording to production manager Alexander Tweedie produce a whisky with a heavy oily flavor. Following distillation The Macallan distillers remove the heads and tails of the whisky and collect approximately 16% of the spirit to fill into casks for maturation. This cutwhich is among the highest of any Scottish distillery results in a more full-bodied and and rich whisky. Bottled by Gordon & MacPhail one of the most prominent independent bottlers in Scotland The Macallan Speymalt 42 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky was originally distilled in 1970 and matured for over four decades in a cask that was previously used to mature sherry. After its maturation the whisky was bottled in 2013. The single-barrel whisky has an aroma of vanilla raisins toasted almonds and a touch of caramel. The aroma gives way to notes of dried fruits particularly cherries and strawberries along with hints of dark chocolate warm spices and Christmas cake. The finish is long and smooth and ends with a touch of creamy vanilla. The Macallan Speymalt 42 Year Old Single Malt Scotch Whisky represents a unique opportunity for Scotch aficionados to try a limited edition bottling from one of the most prestigious distilleries in Scotland.

Harper and Old Charter. The company was known for its innovative practices and strategic acquisitions, which allowed it to thrive after Prohibition was repealed in 1933.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, Schenley had become one of the largest liquor companies in the United States, with a diverse portfolio that included bourbon, rye, gin, vodka, and rum. The company also played a significant role in the Scotch whisky market through its ownership of various distilleries and brands.\n\nSchenley Industries, as it was later known, continued to grow until it was acquired by Guinness in the late 1980s. Despite its eventual decline and closure of its distilleries, Schenley's legacy remains significant in the history of American whiskey production.\n",

These expressions, bottled at barrel proof (typically around 108.4 proof), showcase the distillery's commitment to producing complex, full-flavored whiskeys during a time when the bourbon industry was experiencing a glut of aged stocks. This era of Rare Breed is particularly prized for its rich, multifaceted flavor profile that balances intensity with elegance.\n\nTasting notes for these vintage Rare Breed releases often describe a dense, classic Wild Turkey profile with remarkable depth. The nose typically offers a fragrant bouquet of brandy-like fruitiness, honey-maple sweetness, and medicinal cherry, complemented by caramel creme, sweet oak, and herbal-floral spices. On the palate, enthusiasts report an oily mouthfeel delivering waves of cherry-vanilla, butter toffee, and brown sugar, intertwined with sweet herbs, citrus notes, and warm baking spices. The finish is characteristically long and flavorful, leaving a lasting impression of vanilla bean, cola, and molasses. These batches are often cited as being superior to modern releases, showcasing a perfect harmony of aged stocks that's difficult to replicate in today's high-demand bourbon market.\n",

    "description": "Blanton's is a bourbon brand from the portfolio of Age International, the company formed by former Fleischmann's Distilling director's, Bob Baranaskas and Ferdie Falke. They had approached Schenley in the early 1980s with a view to purchasing its Old Charter brand, but were instead offered Ancient Age and the George T. Stagg distillery where it was produced. The deal was completed in 1983, two years before the retirement of George T. Stagg master distiller, Elmer T. Lee, who had served there for 36 years, working his way from the bottom up. One of his final pioneering triumphs before doing so was the introduction of mass produced single barrel bourbon, specifically through the creation of the Blanton's brand in 1984.  Normally a 6 to 8 year old bourbon, it is aged in Warehouse H at Buffalo Trace, which is the only metal-clad warehouse at the distillery, commissioned for construction by Albert B. Blanton, after whom the whiskey is named. The warehouse was built shortly after prohibition and being metal, transfers heat quicker than brick warehouses, allowing for more rapid ageing.  The popularity of these products was particularly high in Japan, coinciding with a market boom for American whiskey there in the 1980s. In 1991, with Age International in some financial trouble, a Japanese company called Takaro Shuzo stepped in and acquired a 22.5% stake in the company. In an unusual series of events, they then scuppered a deal the following year that was to see the remaining shares sold to Heublein (a subsidiary of Grand Metropolitan). Their deal the year before had included a 30 day right of refusal to purchase the shares for themselves should they be put up for sale. With the deal all but done, the Japanese company stepped in on the final day of the window to acquire full control of the company. As it turned out, their only interest was in the brands, and they had used the 30 days to negotiate a deal with the Sazerac Company of  New Orleans. This saw the American company take ownership of the distillery (which they renamed Buffalo Trace in 1999), as well as the exclusive production and US distribution rights for the Age International labels. This is an arrangement that is still in place today.  This is a 2014 bottling, released for the Japanese market in order to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Blanton's brand in 1984.   Since 1999, every bottle of Blanton's has one of 8 different stoppers, each depicting a horse and jockey at a different stage of finishing a race. The designs are all lettered so that a complete set laid out side by side will spell \"BLANTONS.\" ",

This connection to pre-Prohibition whiskey production adds to the brand's historical significance.\n\nIn more recent times, Echo Spring has been produced by Heaven Hill Distilleries, known for their quality bourbon production. The bourbon is typically aged for at least 3 years, developing a deep gold to orange color with a pale gold hue. On the nose, Echo Spring offers prominent spicy notes, while the palate likely presents a balanced blend of traditional bourbon flavors.\n\n",

    "description": "Talisker Distillers Edition Double Matured Single Malt Whisky is a distinguished expression crafted by one of Scotland's most renowned distilleries, Talisker, situated on the rugged Isle of Skye. This exceptional whisky exemplifies the mastery of traditional distillation techniques and the artistry of maturation.\n\nAt its core, Talisker Distillers Edition begins with the distinct character of Talisker's signature single malt whisky, known for its robust maritime influence and complex flavor profile. The whisky is crafted using malted barley, water sourced from the springs of Hawk Hill, and traditional copper pot stills that impart depth and character to the spirit.\n\nWhat sets the Distillers Edition apart is its unique double maturation process. After the initial aging in American oak barrels, the whisky undergoes a secondary maturation in carefully selected Amoroso sherry casks. This additional period of aging allows the whisky to absorb the rich, sweet flavors of the sherry wood, enhancing its complexity and adding layers of depth to the final product.\n\nThe result is a whisky of remarkable balance and sophistication. On the nose, the Talisker Distillers Edition greets the senses with a captivating blend of smoky peat, maritime brine, and hints of dried fruits and spices. The palate is rich and full-bodied, with flavors of dark chocolate, caramelized nuts, and a subtle sweetness from the sherry influence. The finish is long and warming, with lingering notes of oak, pepper, and sea salt.\n\nTalisker Distillers Edition Double Matured Single Malt Whisky embodies the spirit of its island home, capturing the rugged beauty and untamed nature of the Isle of Skye in every sip. It is a whisky to be savored and appreciated, enjoyed by enthusiasts and connoisseurs alike for its complexity, depth, and timeless appeal.",

Clynelish Reserve has a sweet and fruity flavor, with a spicy undercurrent, just enough to prove it still has bite. Made with water said to come from Clynemilton burn where the water runs over veins of gold in the rock, this single malt is light and floral like Highgarden, but should not be underestimated as it still holds a strong Highland character.  This light-gold Scotch initially offers fresh fruit flavours - such as mango and pineapple - before slipping into rich, sweet vanilla notes. It finishes with sweet, maritime notes that mingle with the light floral flavours which warm and build throughout, leaving the signature sweet Clynelish waxiness behind.",

The distillery was mothballed in 1996 but was revived in 2002, becoming one of the strongest single malt brands globally. \n\nThe Glendronach 18 Years Old Allardice is a tribute to the distillery's founder, James Allardice. This exceptional single malt whisky has been matured for 18 years in the finest Spanish Oloroso sherry casks, offering a rich and unforgettable experience. Bottled at 46%, this whisky is a natural in color and non-chill filtered, preserving its authentic flavors and aromas. \n\nThe Allardice expression was first introduced in 2009 and has since become a heavily-sherried signature of the Glendronach distillery. While older versions may have contained much older whisky due to the distillery's brief closure in 1996, the 2022 release does not have the gentle peat influence found in pre-1996 distillations. \n\nLimited to 1 per customer, this whisky is a collector's item and a must-have for any aficionado of rich, sherried malts. Whether you're a seasoned whisky enthusiast or a newcomer, the Glendronach 18 Years Old Allardice 2022 Release offers a luxurious and deeply satisfying experience.",

    "description": "Rooted in time-honored methods, this bourbon is produced using original two-grain cooker system, maintaining consistent distillation proofs and barrel entry proof to preserve its distinctive character.\n\nHandcrafted with care, each batch of Ben Holladay Bourbon is a testament to dedication to quality. Monthly, the master distiller selects barrels from different floors of two seven-story rickhouses, carefully blending them to meet stringent flavor profile criteria.\n\nPrimarily sourced from barrels aged on the fifth floor of Warehouse C, the largest rickhouse on-site, approximately 80% of the very first batch embodies the essence of this storied location. The remaining 20% hails from barrels on the first floor of the same rickhouse.\n\nEmbracing the unique aging conditions of each floor, subsequent batches of Ben Holladay Bourbon feature varying ratios, reflecting the diverse flavors imparted by temperature variations and humidity levels. From the cooler, more humid conditions of the first floor to the warmer, drier atmospheres of the higher floors, each barrel contributes distinct nuances to the final blend.\n\nTo honor the individuality of each batch, the Ben Holladay Bourbon label showcases a blending chart, guiding consumers through the intricate blending process and enabling them to discern the unique characteristics of each expression. Experience the artistry and tradition of Ben Holladay Bourbon—a true embodiment of quality and craftsmanship.\n\n\n\n",

The whiskey is a blend of high rye and low rye mashbills from Willett, aged for an average of 6.5 years, with some barrels as old as 8 years. After aging, the whiskey is finished in Madeira casks for 14 weeks and subjected to BLACKENED's proprietary Black Noise process, which uses low hertz frequencies from Metallica's music to vibrate the barrels, enhancing the interaction between the whiskey and the wood. The result is a whiskey with a deep amber color and a rich, complex flavor profile that includes notes of red raspberries, strawberry, mint, charred oak, brown sugar, and a hint of grape, leading to a finish with rhubarb, fig, plum, and spice. Bottled at 109.6 proof, this whiskey is a testament to the art of collaboration and innovation in the whiskey-making process.",

Known for his scientific approach to whiskey-making, particularly in refining the sour mash process, Dr. Crow's bourbon gained a reputation for exceptional quality and consistency.\n\nIn its heyday during the late 19th and early-to-mid 20th centuries, Old Crow was considered a premium bourbon, favored by notable figures including Ulysses S. Grant and Mark Twain. The brand reached its peak under National Distillers' ownership, becoming America's best-selling bourbon by the mid-20th century.\n\nAntique versions of Old Crow, particularly those produced before the 1960s, are highly prized by collectors and enthusiasts. These older expressions are noted for their rich, complex flavor profiles, often described as having notes of dried fruits, leather, and well-integrated oak. The brand's decline began in the 1960s due to changes in production methods, but vintage bottles from earlier eras remain sought after for their representation of classic Kentucky bourbon craftsmanship[1][3][4].\n\n",

Made to honour a time when we emerge from winter hibernation, ready to embrace the fresh air, clear skies and long days of summer, the whisky is light and bright. Its delicious warm-season-friendly palate is the result of 17 years' maturation in refill American oak casks, which have a more gentle influence than first-fill European oak casks.

At first you taste hints of lime and green apples, but also of damp leafy soil, pear, vanilla and subtle smoke. It has an even and crisp balance, is full of liveliness and freshness and gives itself fruity on the nose with notes of white pepper, melon, cucumber and herbs. The stimulating finish consists of lime, almond and peach notes and a hint of dried oak. This is the NAS (No Age Statement) version of the Hakushu.\n\nThe Hakushu distillery was opened in 1973 amidst the forests of Kaikomagatake Mountain in the southern Japanese Alps. Due to its mountain location, it is one of the highest distilleries in the world. With its 24 stills, the distillery is also the largest distillery in the world and has an annual capacity of 26 million litres. Due to the different shapes of stills, many different flavours of whisky are distilled at the Haksuhu distillery. The distillery uses extremely pure water that is filtered through millennia-old granite rock. The Hakushu distillery is Suntory's second major whisky distillery alongside the Yamazki distillery.\n\nAroma: Fresh and fruity with lime and green apples, a hint of lemon and smoke.\n\nTaste: Fruity, white pepper, complex with some oak.\n\nFinish: Long and lingering, fruity with some smoke.",

The delicate and fresh notes of honeysuckle, rose and lavender – which are very apparent on the nose at younger ages – contribute to the complexity and final character of Four Roses Bourbon.

The same juice continues to age.  Each year, a small portion of the juice is released, letting the whiskey-loving public taste the differences between it and previous (and younger) releases.\nThe nose is sweet, with burnt caramel, old oak, and pencil shavings.  There’s a slight fruit scent here too.  The palate starts off with toasted oak, then develops into caramel apple, spice, black pepper and leather.  After 21 years in a barrel, this whiskey really shows off its age in the finish.  It is semi-sweet, dry and oaky.",

Entrapment is made of a mash of 97% corn and 3% malted barley giving the whisky aromas of “vanilla, toffee and a delicate toasted oak scent. Entrapment tastes light and creamy with hints of tobacco and walnut. The finish is warm with notes of dried fruits reminiscent of plums and raisins.”  According to the distillery: “These barrels aren’t necessarily forgotten, but instead not chosen for another blend, becoming almost hidden treasures.”",

This concoction, known as the \"Sazerac,\" emerged as America's first branded cocktail, igniting a revolution in mixology that would shape the course of cocktail culture for generations to come.\n\nSazerac Straight Rye captures the essence of this storied past, embodying the spirit of innovation and craftsmanship that defines New Orleans. With each sip, aficionados are transported to a bygone era, where the tantalizing flavors of spicy rye, aromatic bitters, and subtle sweetness blend seamlessly to create a sensory experience like no other.\n\nThis is more than just whiskey—it's a taste of history, a homage to tradition, and a celebration of the vibrant spirit of New Orleans.

A FRESH TAKE ON COGNAC THE NUANCED STRUCTURE OF A GREAT WHISKY MEETS THE FRAGRANT AROMA OF A FINE WINE  A fresher, more fragrant style of Cognac Crafted from a blend of four of the most sought-after crus The result of more than 100 years of Cognac making tradition and craft  FROM GRAPE TO GLASS Maison Thomas is rare among Cognac producers; having complete control of the entire process from the vineyards to the final liquid enjoyed today. We like to think of this as being closer to the cycle of nature. Controlling the process means we don’t need to standardize the liquid with additives like boisé. Martingale is pure and fresh for your enjoyment.  Crafted from a blend of four of the most sought-after crus, with a notable Borderies content, Martingale embodies freshness, fragrance, and refinement.  COLOR: A bright, precious amber with deep golden and honeyed reflections. NOSE: Elegant and refined with notes of spring flowers, acacia, light vanilla, almonds and madeleine. TASTE: Well-rounded with an abundance of freshness. Hints of tannins and oak balance perfectly with subtle floral and fruity notes. FINISH: Soft, long, with lingering notes of elegant sandalwood denoting maturity and refinement.  ABOUT MARTINGALE: A CENTURY IN THE MAKING Martingale Cognac is the result of more than 100 years of Cognac making tradition and craft. From the fourth-generation custodians of one of the most envied domaines in the region comes a new style of Cognac, which honors a proud family’s endless pursuit of excellence while pushing the boundaries of creativity. Martingale is fresh, fragrant, and refined; offering an exquisite balance of complexity and smoothness.  Raymond Thomas—grandfather of founders Guillaume and Amaury Thomas—was a true entrepreneur; relentless, brave and undeterred by risks and setbacks. Martingale is a tribute to Raymond’s legacy and his belief in doubling down rather than backing down.  The Thomas family has been making Cognac for over a century, supplying the most prestigious brands with outstanding quality product, and in doing so has built one of the largest vineyards and distilleries throughout the famed appellation. Their products have, until now, been enjoyed anonymously.  The 2023 release of Martingale Cognac marks a very important milestone for this proud and determined family. The uniqueness of the liquid and packaging are testament to Raymond’s vision and entrepreneurial spirit, which lives on in his grandsons.",

    "name": "Found North Peregrine First Flight 20 Year - 2023",
    "description": "Peregrine First Flight is the first 20 year old age-stated whisky we have released and is the culmination of a whisky-making process that we have been developing for the last several years. Our love for Canadian whisky is rooted in blending. Canadian whisky is made by distilling and aging individual grains in order to maximize the creative flexibility of the blender. With Peregrine we took this process a step further. We created a blend and then recasked it into French Limousin, American ex-Cognac and new American oak casks for a 5-month further maturation. After 5 months we took the best 7 casks and reblended them to create Peregrine.  Peregrine started as a blend of 20 year old rye aged in ex-Speyside scotch casks, 22 year old corn in new American oak, 23 year old corn in refill oak, 24 year old corn in ex-bourbon and 27 year old corn in Hungarian oak. Before we further matured this whisky it was blended to create a balanced whisky with a clean palate. The nose was bright with milk chocolate, honeysuckle, orchard fruits, caramel and black pepper. The palate and body were light and fresh. In a synesthetic way, we planned for the original blend to consist of bright, vibrant colors, knowing the further maturation would darken, enliven and enrich the entire profile and tenor of the whisky.  After its further maturation in three different oak types and its reblend, the final whisky is elegant and decadent. The marvel of this whisky is the perfect integration of all the flavors across the entire palate, deep into the finish.  Flavor Notes The moment you pour Peregrine, candied peaches, exotic wood spice, lavender, milk chocolate and ground cashews flow from the glass in one harmonious chord. The combination of fruit, spice, wood, vanillin and citrus are exceptionally balanced with only a slight emphasis on the bouquet of glazed fruit notes - a symphony of clementine, raspberry and red apple.  Peregrine lands on the palate with a wintry freshness, followed almost immediately by a surging, fruity oiliness. The elegant mid palate thickens into a viscous combination of chocolate, orange and vanilla bean. As it spreads to the side palates, it transitions into cinnamon and herbaceous spice. The back of the palate erupts with sandalwood, lavender, shortbread and a touch of black pepper, barely hinting at its 126.2 proof. The momentary tannic warmth precedes a three stage finish. First comes a sweet gingerbread baking spice, followed by rich tonka bean and orange blossom water and finally, a lingering shortbread with mint leaf that echoes eternal.  Why We Made This Whisky The word “peregrine” derives from the medieval Latin “falco peregrinus” which translates to “pilgrim falcon.” In medieval times, falconers who wanted to train peregrines could not access their incredibly high nests. In order to train a peregrine, a falconer had to capture one on its “first flight,” its first migratory pilgrimage. Hence the name “falco peregrinus.”  We created Peregrine because we love the process of shaping and reshaping whisky through blending and maturation. When you recask a whisky you allow it to change its trajectory, move in a new direction. By blending the whisky before further maturation, we controlled the starting point. Good maturation of whisky requires matching the wood to the distillate, but we thought - what if we shape the liquid itself to best match a particular maturation regimen?  We named this whisky “Peregrine” because it resonates with our ethos and our belief that Found North is an ongoing exploration, a continual journey. And we named this collection “The High Altitude Collection” because we believe this process of creating a blend for the purpose of further maturation will take great whisky to new heights.",

Crow in the 1830s. This process involves using a portion of the previous fermentation's mash to start the new batch, ensuring consistency and quality. The bottle features a classic design with the \"Old Crow\" branding prominently displayed, along with the text \"Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey\" and \"Sour Mash.\" The amber-colored liquid inside reflects its rich heritage. Old Crow was once the top-selling bourbon in the United States and was favored by notable figures such as President Ulysses S. Grant and writer Mark Twain. Today, it is produced by Jim Beam and remains a value-oriented bourbon, known for its light caramel, oak, and grain flavors with subtle vanilla and banana notes. Despite its decline in prestige, Old Crow continues to be a significant name in the world of bourbon, representing a storied legacy in American whiskey history.",

    "description": "Black Unicorn Whisky is a remarkable creation by LeNell Camacho Santa Ana, the owner of LeNell’s Beverage Boutique in Birmingham, Alabama. This inaugural expression is not merely a product launch; it represents a transformative vision inspired by a deep appreciation for art and a desire to foster genuine connections with distillers. Camacho Santa Ana emphasizes that her approach transcends typical barrel pick programs, focusing instead on the emotional and artistic resonance of the whiskey-making process.\n\nThe whisky itself is a high-proof spirit with an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 74.7%, distilled at Charbay Distillery in California. It features a unique mash bill of 52% corn and 48% two-row barley, carefully crafted using a custom-made alembic pot still. This meticulous distillation process enhances the whisky's malty richness, resulting in a complex flavor profile that has garnered attention from enthusiasts worldwide.\n\nCamacho Santa Ana’s journey to create Black Unicorn began at the Birmingham art festival, where she encountered John Lytle Wilson's evocative painting, \"Enter the Unicorn.\" This experience ignited her creative spirit and led to a collaboration that would see Wilson's artwork featured on the bottle. The production process was intricate, involving legal negotiations and artistic refinements to ensure that the final product was not only a high-quality whisky but also a work of art.\n\nEach bottle of Black Unicorn is hand-filled, labeled, and sealed with a unique wax featuring glittering hearts and stars, making it a collectible item. With only 248 bottles produced, this limited release is priced at $500 per 750-ml bottle, reflecting its artisanal nature and the care invested in its creation.\n\nLooking ahead, Camacho Santa Ana plans to continue her mission of collaborating with distillers to create innovative expressions of Black Unicorn, with future releases expected to retail at more accessible prices. Her commitment to artistry and community is further demonstrated through her support for local initiatives, including her corporate charity, TAKE Birmingham, which serves the needs of the local black transgender community. Black Unicorn Whisky is not just a drink; it embodies a heartfelt connection between the creator, the distillers, and the consumers, celebrating the spirit of creativity and collaboration in the world of whisky.\n",

    "description": "The Wild Turkey 8 Year 101 Proof, a Japan-exclusive release, offers bourbon enthusiasts a unique opportunity to experience a carefully aged expression of this iconic Kentucky whiskey. Bottled at the classic 101 proof (50.5% ABV), this bourbon showcases the distillery's commitment to crafting high-quality spirits for the discerning Japanese market. The 8-year age statement sets it apart from the standard Wild Turkey 101 available in the United States, promising a more refined and complex flavor profile.\n\nOn the nose, this bourbon presents a rich bouquet of aromas, including caramel, vanilla, and toasted oak, with subtle hints of dried fruit and spices. The palate delivers a robust flavor experience, featuring a harmonious blend of sweet and spicy notes. Expect to taste layers of butterscotch, cinnamon, and nutmeg, underpinned by the characteristic Wild Turkey \"funk\" that enthusiasts have come to love. The 8 years of aging in heavily charred American oak barrels imparts a depth and maturity that elevates this expression above its younger counterparts, resulting in a smoother, more balanced sip with a long, warming finish that lingers with notes of oak and sweet spices. While not as rare or sought-after as its 12-year-old sibling, the Wild Turkey 8 Year 101 Proof remains a prized find for bourbon collectors and a testament to Wild Turkey's global appeal.\n\n",

This single barrel bourbon, bottled at 101 proof (50.5% ABV), was Wild Turkey's answer to the growing premium bourbon market of the 1990s, particularly in response to the success of Blanton's. The distinctive bottle design, shaped like a turkey with fanned feathers, and the weighty pewter stopper made it stand out on shelves and in collections.\n\nWhat makes the pewter top Kentucky Spirit releases particularly special is their connection to Wild Turkey's heritage. These bottles were often filled with bourbon from Warehouses A, B, and C on the original Tyrone campus, which were personal favorites of Master Distiller Jimmy Russell. The age of the whiskey in these bottles is believed to range from 8 to 14 years, with some early releases potentially containing even older stocks. Tasting notes for these vintage Kentucky Spirits often describe a rich, complex flavor profile featuring the classic Wild Turkey \"funk\" - a combination of robust oak, vanilla, caramel, and spice, with a distinctive fruity and sometimes medicinal character that sets it apart from other bourbons of the era. Today, these pewter top releases are highly prized by collectors and enthusiasts, not just for their historical significance, but for the quality and unique character of the bourbon they contain.\n",

    "description": "Nose: Honey, bold caramel-oak, star anise, a damp earthy funk as it opens up. Initially it reminds me of a butterscotch treat. It has a kind of lemon-brightness. Not lemon nose, but if you can imagine that brightness but with an oak note. After a good 5-10 minutes, the nose is exploding with caramel, its absurd. It's very oily as I swirl it around the glass, lots of streaks.  Palate: Burst of caramel, cinnamon. Extremely light and airy. There is a bit of ethanol from the alcohol, but it fades extremely quickly and shoots back to the caramel note. Its very one-dimensional. I want to say \"short\" but this is really more thin and airy, not brief. The palate is there, but far more subdued than the nose would suggest and its just not complex at all. In my notes I wrote \"watery?\", because it just kinda coats your mouth. Those oils from the glass are all over immediately and you feel it. An initial small burst of flavor from something sitting in an oak barrel for a decade+, but no nuance at all.  Finish: Oh baby. OH BABY. There it is. There's the 10+yr MGP. Its crazy because the palate ends for just a moment you think \"is that it?\", then BAM. Stunning bold oak that is remarkably smooth as it goes down. Honey-ed oak with baking spices. Im honestly amazed by how hard the finish is hitting. Wow. Oak, caramel, cinnamon in that order on repeat for a good 5+ minutes. Wonderful meld of cinnamon and oak for a good few minutes after it goes down. God damn.",

When vatting the 30 year old expression in 2006  the Macallan filled 10 barrels with mature whisky to gently marry before bottling. They dumped 9 of these marrying casks for the 30 year old release but identified one cask that they felt could be further matured. The refill butt was assessed in 2011 at 35 years of age, but with more left to give the team left it be. In 2016, at a minimum of 40 years old the cask was finally dumped and bottled. As this vatting contained 9 different vintages the spirit in this release is minimum 40 years, with up to approximately 49 year old spirit contained as well. The long marriage has allowed for the spirit to be perfectly integrated, with the 2016 release heralded as one of the distillery's best.",

Sauternes is Bordeaux’s sweet late-harvest white wine mostly made up of sémillon with some sauvignon blanc and muscadelle. What sets Sauternes apart is the grapes have been infected with Botrytis cinerea – AKA noble rot. Why does that matter? Botrytis draws water out of the grapes making their juice yield low but that juice very concentrated. Combine the timing of late harvest when grapes have developed all the sugar they can with dehydration and you get a syrupy starting point. Noble rot also fosters flavors like honey ginger and beeswax likely due to increased levels of an aroma compound phenylacetaldehyde. This liquid is a very clear medium copper that beads and forms slow fat tears. Sweet and spicy stone fruit and gingersnaps with vanilla perfume woven through. Full on the palate in both flavor and texture. Oaky vanilla comes through strongly backed up with black pepper cinnamon and considerable heat. Sweet white flowers and apricot surface with the addition of a little water. Spiciness lingers on the long finish.",

Thankfully,, the proprietors of that fine establishment are kind enough to let some casks make their way to independent bottlers. When a few casks of rum distilled in 1998 by Foursquare came available, Rolling Fork jumped at the opportunity to bring some of that well-aged rum stateside. The nose smells like someone baked an apple pie in a wood-fired oven using cedar and seasoned oak. In this long-aged rum,, the classic notes of a Foursquare distilled rum,, including floral and citrus make a brief appearance. However,, as may be expected from a rum aged 22 years,, the barrel influence delivers vanilla,, caramel,, and strong baking spice notes. Seasoned oak and baking spice notes take over and lead to a warming cedar and oak finish that lingers. This cask is bottled as nature intended at cask strength,, non-chill filtered,, and without any additives. The yield for this cask was 222 bottles.\n\n\n\n",

Though it was closed for a good portion of the early 1900s, it reopened in 1966, only to be closed in 1983, around the time that many other Scottish whisky distilleries were closed too. Their stock has become rare and sought-after by whisky enthusiasts.

When his father, Lesley Samuels, died in 1936, Bill inherited the running of the place, which he did so until 1942 when he sold it and its brands to Country Distillers Products. Bill has initially intended to retire to his farm, but the allure of creating a new bourbon proved too much, and he set about canvassing help in producing the recipe for the smoothers tasting whiskey that he has campaigned for and failed to get the family to distil over a decade prior. Among those who he reached out to were Hap Motlow of Jack Daniel's, Ed Shapira of Heaven Hill, and the legendary Julian 'Pappy' Van Winkle I. Pappy's wheated Old Weller and Old Fitzgerald bourbon were exactly the profile that Samuels was after, and with Van Winkle's help, he debuted finessed his own wheat mashbill, and bought land in Loretto, Kentucky in 1953. He filled his first barrels the following year, and in the years that preceded his first bottlings, Bill's wife Margie created the Maker's Mark brand based on her collections of fine English pewter stamps. The first bottle of Maker's Mark was bottled on 8th May 1958, and was hand-dipped with red wax, as all bottles still are to this day.   The VIP series are bottled in replicas of an 1870s glass in the distillery museum. They are individually labelled with personalised messages.",

    "description": "Buffalo Trace Distillery began experimenting with recipes and barrel treatments more than two decades ago. Currently there are more than 30,000 experimental barrels of whiskey aging in its warehouses. Each of the barrels has unique characteristics and experimental changes in the mash bill, types of wood, barrel toasts and more. Periodically, an experimental whiskey is bottled and sold on a limited basis.\n\nThis whiskey aged for six years and three months in a new American white oak barrel before it was rebarreled into a used American oak Zinfandel barrel. There it was aged for another eight years, making it a total of 14 years old. The expected wine fruitiness is absent in the initial palate, but is replaced with an exciting spiciness. It is not the rye-grain spice normally associated with bourbon, but a grape-vine herbal quality that slides across the tongue and lingers for what seems like forever. This is an epic whiskey with grandeur and grace. Old world quaffing of a vine and field mélange.",

The collection, an annual release series, draws its inspiration from the 485-acre Macallan Estate, a stunning testament to natural beauty and history. The estate, located on the banks of the River Spey, was transformed into a flourishing community with the establishment of Easter Elchies House by Captain John Grant and later the foundation of the whisky-making facility by schoolteacher Alexander Reid in 1824​​.  \"The Distillery\", the first release in this collection, is a celebration of The Macallan's modern distillery building, a design marvel by the globally acclaimed Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners. The building's roof, blanketed with grass and wildflowers, blends harmoniously with the surrounding landscape, reflecting the brand's commitment to nature and sustainability​​.  In a tribute to The Macallan's traditions and community spirit, the whisky is crafted from a unique combination of European and American oak barrels and refill casks. It features a deep gold color, with a complex nose of sweet spice and a mellowing palate, ending in a rich, medium finish. This sensory experience aims to embody the warm welcome of The Macallan Estate​​.  A key highlight of the collection is the artwork adorning its packaging. Local artist and long-standing Macallan employee Colin Rizza, whose family has been associated with The Macallan for over three decades, crafted a watercolor painting of the distillery for the bottle. This artwork symbolizes not just the scenic beauty of the distillery but also the deep connection and sense of belonging Rizza and his family feel towards The Macallan Estate. His talent in art has been recognized and utilized by The Macallan community in various capacities over the years​.",

    "description": "Wild Turkey 101 8-Year Bourbon, exclusively released in Japan, represents a mature and sophisticated variant of the widely recognized Wild Turkey 101 available in the United States. This 8-year age-stated bourbon introduces a nuanced and refined profile, offering a distinguished tasting experience for aficionados and casual drinkers alike.\n\nTasting Profile:\n\nNose: The aromatic profile presents a harmonious blend of sweet and spicy notes, characterized by prominent oak, caramel, nuts, and baking spices. A distinctive citronella candle-like note introduces a subtle blend of citrus and floral elements.\n\nPalate: The palate delivers a balanced sip, introducing spice at the forefront, followed by oak and fruit nuances. Fruit notes, reminiscent of plum and black cherries, are evident, complemented by a subtle vanilla undertone. The complexity and refinement are enhanced by the 8-year aging process, presenting a profile that is roasty, oaky, and spice-forward, with a subtle oaky nuance.\n\nFinish: The finish is characterized by sweet, spicy, and slightly nutty notes, with a lingering presence of fruit leathers and a pronounced oak note. It concludes with toasted caramel, brown sugar, savory citrus, butterscotch, and subtle hints of cola and white pepper, providing a classic and satisfying end.\n\nWhen compared to other Wild Turkey offerings, the 8-year variant of Wild Turkey 101 demonstrates a notable increase in complexity and refinement. While maintaining the signature boldness synonymous with Wild Turkey, this expression introduces it with a well-articulated Kentucky grace. Although it may not encapsulate the rich oak, medicinal cherry, and sweet leather of the 12-year export, the toffee, caramel, and savory citrus notes of the 8-year version are sufficiently compelling to captivate the palate.\n",

    "name": "Cork Paddy Distillato Di Cereali",
    "description": "Paddy Irish Whiskey, produced by Cork Distilleries Company, has a rich and storied history that dates back to the late 19th century. The company was founded in 1867 through the amalgamation of four distilleries in Cork city: North Mall, The Green, Watercourse Road, and Daly's, with Midleton Distillery joining soon after in 1868. This consolidation aimed to stabilize and enhance the quality of Irish whiskey production during a challenging period for the industry.\n\nIn 1882, a young salesman named Paddy Flaherty joined the company and began marketing the company's whiskey, then known as \"Cork Distilleries Company Old Irish Whiskey.\" Flaherty's innovative sales techniques, which included giving out free rounds of drinks, made him a beloved figure in the pubs of Cork. His efforts were so successful that publicans began referring to the whiskey as \"Paddy Flaherty's whiskey,\" leading to the official renaming of the brand to \"Paddy Irish Whiskey\" in 1912 to honor his legacy.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Cork Distilleries Company became one of the first to bottle their own whiskey, a move aimed at preventing quality fluctuations caused by middlemen diluting casks. This decision helped solidify Paddy's reputation for consistency and quality. The whiskey is triple distilled and matured in oak casks for up to seven years, known for its smooth, light, and balanced profile with a high malt content compared to other Irish whiskeys.\n\nIn 1988, Irish Distillers, which had formed through a merger involving Cork Distilleries Company, was acquired by Pernod Ricard. Paddy Whiskey continued to thrive under this ownership until 2016, when it was sold to the Sazerac Company. Today, Paddy remains one of the top-selling Irish whiskey brands globally, celebrated for its accessibility and the legendary spirit of its namesake, Paddy Flaherty.\n",

This expression was distilled and bottled during a time when Heaven Hill was experiencing remarkable growth, despite the overall bourbon industry facing challenges.\n\nDuring the 1980s, Heaven Hill was gaining recognition for offering high-quality bourbon at competitive prices. This 10-year-old expression would have been part of their premium lineup, demonstrating the distillery's commitment to aged whiskeys at a time when many producers were focusing on younger spirits.\n\nBottles of Heaven Hill 10 Year Old from the 1980s are particularly valuable to collectors and bourbon enthusiasts. They represent whiskey produced before the devastating 1996 fire that destroyed Heaven Hill's original distillery and seven of its warehouses. This tragic event makes pre-fire Heaven Hill bourbons, like this 10-year-old expression, even more rare and historically significant.\n\nToday, these bottles are highly prized at auctions, with prices reflecting their scarcity and the growing interest in vintage American whiskeys. For bourbon aficionados, tasting this 1980s Heaven Hill 10 Year Old offers a unique opportunity to experience a piece of Kentucky bourbon history.\n",

    "description": "Paddy Irish Whiskey, produced by Cork Distilleries Company, has a rich and storied history that dates back to the late 19th century. The company was founded in 1867 through the amalgamation of four distilleries in Cork city: North Mall, The Green, Watercourse Road, and Daly's, with Midleton Distillery joining soon after in 1868. This consolidation aimed to stabilize and enhance the quality of Irish whiskey production during a challenging period for the industry.\n\nIn 1882, a young salesman named Paddy Flaherty joined the company and began marketing the company's whiskey, then known as \"Cork Distilleries Company Old Irish Whiskey.\" Flaherty's innovative sales techniques, which included giving out free rounds of drinks, made him a beloved figure in the pubs of Cork. His efforts were so successful that publicans began referring to the whiskey as \"Paddy Flaherty's whiskey,\" leading to the official renaming of the brand to \"Paddy Irish Whiskey\" in 1912 to honor his legacy.\n\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, Cork Distilleries Company became one of the first to bottle their own whiskey, a move aimed at preventing quality fluctuations caused by middlemen diluting casks. This decision helped solidify Paddy's reputation for consistency and quality. The whiskey is triple distilled and matured in oak casks for up to seven years, known for its smooth, light, and balanced profile with a high malt content compared to other Irish whiskeys.\n\nIn 1988, Irish Distillers, which had formed through a merger involving Cork Distilleries Company, was acquired by Pernod Ricard. Paddy Whiskey continued to thrive under this ownership until 2016, when it was sold to the Sazerac Company. Today, Paddy remains one of the top-selling Irish whiskey brands globally, celebrated for its accessibility and the legendary spirit of its namesake, Paddy Flaherty.\n\n",

Crafted by eighth-generation Beam family distiller Freddie Noe, Toast represents a significant departure from the brand's traditional high-rye recipe.\n\nThe bourbon introduces an innovative approach by replacing rye grain with US-grown brown rice, creating a unique mashbill that delivers a softer, sweeter profile. A secondary toasted barrel finish further distinguishes this expression, drawing out notes of caramelized sugar and toasted wood. Noe developed the bourbon as a continuation of his grandfather Booker Noe's mission to make bourbon more approachable and exploratory.\n\nAlongside the liquid innovation, Toast also marked a significant packaging update for the Basil Hayden brand. The new design features an enlarged, prominent metal \"belt buckle\" inspired by the metal hoops that encircle bourbon barrels, symbolizing the brand's connection to bourbon-making tradition.\n",

This bourbon was introduced as a single-barrel expression, showcasing the remarkable quality and distinctiveness of bourbon unblended from multiple barrels.\n\nTasting Experience: A journey into the heart of bourbon crafting, each sip of Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel echoes the traditional bourbon-making prowess.\n\nNose: The first whiff offers a sweet and spicy aroma, with hints of leather and a subtle touch of roasted marshmallow adding to the complexity.\n\nPalate: Contrary to the sweet notes in the aroma, the first sip presents a drier taste profile with flavors of dark chocolate and tobacco. The bourbon has a dry character, making it reminiscent of a fine single malt but without the peat, appealing especially to Scotch drinkers exploring bourbon.\n\nFinish: The finish is unique, with a gentle burn that travels in reverse, from the chest back up to the throat, lingering until the next sip. This trait makes it a desirable choice for sipping in cold weather, warming up the senses with each sip.\n\nThe Rock Hill Farms Single Barrel, with its higher-rye mash bill (believed to consist of 12% to 15% rye), showcases a different facet of bourbon, offering a taste that is as rich in history as it is in flavor. The bourbon was available in both 100 proof and 80 proof versions, and it resonated well with critics, scoring an impressive 98 points in some circles.",

This high-rye recipe is also shared with Old Grand-Dad bourbons, creating a family of spirits with a spicy character.\n\nThe 10 Year expression represents Basil Hayden's oldest release to date, aiming to offer a more mature and complex version of the brand's signature light and approachable style. It's bottled at the same 80 proof (40% ABV) as the standard offering, maintaining the brand's reputation for smooth, easy-drinking bourbon.\n\nPresented in an elegant bottle with Basil Hayden's characteristic metal bib, the 10 Year variant is positioned as a premium option for both longtime fans of the brand and bourbon enthusiasts seeking a refined, aged expression. While it commands a higher price point than its younger sibling, it remains competitively priced within the aged bourbon market.\n\nThis limited release typically appears on shelves during the holiday season, adding a special touch to Basil Hayden's lineup and offering consumers a chance to experience how extended aging affects the brand's distinctive flavor profile.\n",

This innovative blend combines four 4-year-old straight malt whiskeys, each finished in different types of wood—cherrywood staves, applewood smoked barrels, hickory smoked barrels, and maplewood staves—with a 5-year-old Kentucky straight bourbon. Bottled at a cask strength of 117.4 proof, this whiskey showcases a complex flavor profile that includes notes of honeysuckle, cherry, caramelized brown sugar, earthy moss, wild mushrooms, and a hint of barbeque smoke. \"To The Finish\" exemplifies Freddie Noe's creative approach to whiskey blending, using unique wood finishes to enhance the depth and character of the whiskey, making it a standout addition to the Little Book series.",

This expression has an alcohol by volume (ABV) of 45% and is described as a well-made, serious bourbon suitable for pairing with cigars. The bourbon is noted for its tasting profile which includes the aroma of cooked fruits, bitter orange, rum and raisin, with almost leathery notes, pipe smoke, and allspice. The palate is described as sweet and deep, but with very pure flavors, including grilled nut and old-fashioned rose. It has a finish that begins to dry and shows some good maturity. This bourbon has been rated 7.8 by Dave Broom and Michael Jackson, with tasting notes mentioning flavors of almond essence, vanilla, and corn muffins on the palate, with a toasty and crisp finish.\n\nThe Old Charter brand has a rich history dating back to the late 19th century when it was created by the Chapeze brothers. It survived the Prohibition era and was bought by the Bernheim distillery at the close of Prohibition in 1933, which later became part of the Schenley empire in 1937. The Classic 90, 12 Years Old expression was historically produced by Schenley at the Bernheim distillery and is aged in Virgin American Oak barrels.\n\nMoreover, it's noted that this expression is no longer in production, making it a potentially collectible item. \n\nWould you like to know more about where you might purchase this bourbon or any other details?",

As with the Flora & Fauna series, they were often from lesser-seen single malt distilleries. This very rare Mortlach was distilled in 1972 and bottled in 1995. Mortlach was founded in 1823 and was the first of Dufftown's \"Seven Stills\" to be licensed. It rose to pre-eminence under George Cowie & Son, who's unique distillation regime produced a famously \"meaty\" whisky, which was highly prized by blenders. It was for this reason that it was acquired by John Walker & Sons, and so important to them was it that little stock was left available for bottling as a single malt. The Flora & Fauna release was the first official distillery bottling, but it was not until 2014 that a permanent range was finally added.",

Each barrel in this series is meticulously hand-selected by co-founder Pablo Moix, ensuring that only whiskeys of exceptional quality make the cut.\n\nThe Single Barrel Series is characterized by its diversity and individuality, with each release reflecting a distinct flavor profile and character. These whiskeys are typically sourced from well-known distilleries, including those in Indiana, and feature a range of mash bills. For instance, one bourbon in the series has a mash bill of 60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% malted barley, delivering a flavorful experience with notes of sweet vanilla, baking spices, and a hint of rye spice.\n\nThe packaging of the Single Barrel Series adds to its allure, with each bottle adorned with a unique painting and sealed with a wax top, creating an engaging unboxing experience. The proof of these bourbons often hovers around 120, showcasing a bold character that appeals to enthusiasts who appreciate higher-proof offerings.\n\nOverall, the Single Barrel Series by Rare Character is a celebration of craftsmanship, creativity, and the rich heritage of American whiskey, making it a sought-after choice for collectors and connoisseurs alike.\n\n",

Part of the Takara series, which also includes Takara Black and Takara Gold, this expression is highly sought after by bourbon enthusiasts and collectors around the world.\n\nTakara Red is distinguished by its unique characteristics, including an aging process that is rumored to be a minimum of eight years, although this is not officially confirmed on the label. It is bottled at 93 proof (46.5% ABV), the same as the standard Blanton's Single Barrel, ensuring a robust flavor profile.\n\nThe packaging of Takara Red adds to its allure, featuring a distinctive red box with a woven texture and a deep maroon bag that contrasts with the brown bag of domestic Blanton's. The bottle is adorned with a gold-colored wax seal, similar to that found on Blanton's Straight From The Barrel. The label showcases light brown handwritten and printed portions, along with Japanese script spelling out \"Whiskey,\" further emphasizing its exclusivity.\n\nThe Takara Red series is particularly interesting for collectors due to its limited availability and the variations that can arise from individual barrel selections. Some special releases within this series, such as the HBA (Hotel Barmen Association Japan) Single Barrel picks, offer even more unique expressions.\n\nWhile many enthusiasts speculate about the potential superiority of the Takara series due to its rumored longer aging process, recent reviews suggest that modern releases may be more comparable in quality to standard Blanton's. Nevertheless, Takara Red remains a highly coveted expression in the bourbon world, often commanding premium prices on the secondary market.",

The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

Curley built a hugely positive reputation in the late 1800s for his high quality whiskies produced at the Blue Grass distillery, later building the Boone's Knoll distillery at Camp Nelson. Blue Grass was a small distillery with quite a limited output, resulting in Curley struggling to grow his business past the two distilleries he had built. In 1889 his horses and wagons were impounded for not paying his taxes, and so he decided to sell up to The Whiskey Trust. The Trust would continue operating the distilleries until prohibition closed them, but continued to sell the bonded barrels leftover from production throughout the prohibition period.",

    "name": "Yamazaki 55 Year",
    "description": "The oldest whisky produced to date by Suntory, the Yamazaki 55 year old represents the absolute pinnacle of rare whisky.\n\nCrafted from two unique styles of Yamazaki, one distilled in 1960 and matured in Mizunara casks as well as a 1964 vintage matured in white oak casks, it was delicately blended and bottled in 2020.\n\nThe bottle itself is a work of art, encased in a crystal bottle adorned with gold dust and lacquer, wrapped in handmade washi paper, and presented in a bespoke Mizunara wood box.\n\nYamazaki was the first whisky distillery in Japan, founded in 1924 by Shinjiro Torri’s firm Kotobukiya under the helm of Masataka Taketsuru, who had just returned from Scotland after a three year trip learning how to make whisky. Torri signed Taketsuru to a 10 year contract and tasked him with production of a Japanese made whisky. It would take till 1929 before Suntory white label would be released, ultimately failing due to its peated style. The pair would split at the end of Taketsuru’s contract, but Yamazaki would ultimately prosper once the unpeated Kakubin was released. \n\nFor much of the 20th century Japanese whisky was relegated to cheap blended products, with Yamazaki making grain and malt whisky for its blends as well as likely using cheap imported Scotch whisky. But in 1984 the firm pivoted, and began releasing Yamazaki as a pure malt whisky. This was risky as the wider whisky market was still almost entirely drinking blended whiskies, but Suntory wanted to differentiate. They launched Hibiki in 1989 to satisfy the blended market and even launched an 18 year old and 25 year old Yamazaki malt whisky as the 1990s ticked along.\n\nAs the turn of the millennium crept around Japanese whisky was winning more and more awards. And by the 2010s demand for the spirit had pivoted and age stated expressions of Japanese whisky were rapidly being discontinued. Yamazaki especially suffered and the 18 has become a super premium offering in the last decade. Old stocks of this esteemed distillery are few and far between, and those that do survive are now amongst the most sought after bottles in the world.\n\nThe use of Mizunara oak came out of necessity as imported American white oak became difficult to acquire post WWII. The Japanese whisky makers turned to local oak to try and satisfy their need for casks. Mizunara is notoriously difficult to work with, often being used instead for furniture. These endemic Japanese trees need 200 years on average to meet requirement for cask making and so are both expensive and highly allocated. Despite this difficulty the Japanese makers at Suntory found the oak to impart a wholly unique flavour, often drawing parallels to notes of coconut and sandalwood. Suntory continued the use of these precious oak casks and they have been a core component of what makes Yamazaki single malt so special.",

    "description": "Situated in Speyside, Miltonduff distillery boasts a storied history, renowned as a cornerstone malt in the illustrious Ballantine's blends. Acquired by Hiram Walker in the 1930s, Miltonduff witnessed the installation of Lomond stills, which briefly birthed the coveted Mosstowie single malts in 1964 before their removal in 1981. Transitioning through Allied Distillers' ownership, the distillery now rests under the stewardship of Pernod-Ricard. Despite its steadfast contribution to Ballantine's blends, Miltonduff's single malt expressions have earned acclaim, both from its proprietors and independent bottlers.\n\nThis particular whisky emerges from a harmonious vatting of three bourbon hogsheads, subsequently transferred to nine 50-liter sherry firkins after nearly a decade of maturation. These casks were then carefully nestled in a dunnage warehouse for an additional six months, allowing the whisky to develop its distinctive character.\n\nEstablished in 1842 by George Duncan, Wm. Cadenhead stands as Scotland's oldest independent bottler. With William Cadenhead assuming leadership post-1958, the company burgeoned into the whisky bottling realm after 1904 under Robert Duthie's guidance. Since its acquisition by J&A Mitchell in 1972, Wm. Cadenhead has become a revered name in whisky circles. While the Authentic Collection remains its flagship brand, the company's portfolio has expanded to include labels such as this one, a testament to its enduring commitment to quality and tradition.",

Introduced in 1984 by Elmer T. Lee at Buffalo Trace Distillery, Blanton's has become a benchmark for quality and craftsmanship in the bourbon industry.\n\nEach bottle of Blanton's is drawn from a single barrel, allowing for unique flavor profiles that can vary from one barrel to another. This meticulous process ensures that every release offers a distinct character while maintaining the brand's signature smoothness and complexity. The bourbon is typically aged for six to eight years in charred American oak barrels, which contributes to its rich flavor.\n\nBlanton's is easily recognizable thanks to its iconic bottle design, featuring a distinctive horse and jockey topper that has become a symbol of the brand. The bourbon is available in several variations, including the original 93-proof version, the higher-proof Blanton’s Gold, and the special Reserve edition.\n\nOver the years, Blanton's has garnered a devoted following among whiskey enthusiasts and collectors, often commanding high prices on the secondary market due to its limited availability and consistent quality. Its reputation as a classic bourbon makes it a staple in bars and homes alike, appealing to both seasoned connoisseurs and those new to the world of bourbon.\n\n",

Always racing straight to the punch, we only ask that you politely accept The Gifted Horse for what it is – its own unique offering. Some time ago at the historic Stitzel-Weller Distillery, the unthinkable happened. A batch of beautiful 17-year-old Kentucky straight bourbon was accidently mixed with barrels of much younger whiskey. This error turned out better expected as the older bourbon wasn’t marred, but transformed into something surprisingly special. Beginning with a nose hinting at apple skin, almond, toffee, raisins and slight milk chocolate, The Gifted Horse has unique tastes of creamy caramel, Bosc pear and fruit cake. This unusual blend’s fruity notes become more apparent with a splash of water.\"",

    "description": "Orphan Barrel Whiskey Distilling Company is a dedicated cause, acquiring some of the rarest casks from some of the finest whiskey cellars, and releasing them into the world a cascade of limited edition, barrel aged ambrosia. In 2013 bourbon and Tennessee whiskey were labeled the fastest growing product category by volume in the U.S. alcohol business. The Orphan bottling project was more or less an ingenious response to this boom in the whiskey industry, and an effort to accommodate the vast quantities of leftover product from their monopoly of acquisitions. When Diageo didn't have a place for the acquired product in their blends, they set the spirits aside. Time transformed this new spirit into aged delicacies. In 2013, Orphan Barrel Whiskey was created by Diageo, commercializing a large stock of ultra-aged American whiskeys that it had been maturing at the Stitzel-Weller distillery in Shively Kentucky. The fifth expression of Diageo's Orphan Barrel line, Forged Oak is crafted from a mashbill of 86% corn, 7% barley, and 6% rye and aged for 15 years. “ A statuesque whiskey with aromas of cedar, maple and vanilla bean that give way to seasoned woody notes of cocoa and young berries, ultimately leading to a long, dry finish of black pepper” (producer).",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

At a mere sixteen years old, he commenced his journey in the Distillery as an office boy, swiftly ascending to become a pioneering force in bourbon's evolution. Assuming the mantle of company president in 1921, he orchestrated a monumental expansion, propelling the Distillery from 44 to 144 buildings, solidifying its status as the era's premier bourbon producer.  Throughout his tenure until his retirement in 1952, Colonel Blanton curated his exclusive and scarce reserve of bourbon—his personal selection—meticulously stored within the hallowed halls of Warehouse H, now an iconic landmark. Though Colonel Blanton passed in the spring of 1959, his legacy endures.  In 1984, Blanton's eponymous bourbon made its debut, marking the inception of the first-ever commercially available Single Barrel Bourbon. A testament to Blanton's unwavering commitment to excellence, the Single Barrel Bourbon stands as a pioneering achievement, forever altering the landscape of bourbon craftsmanship.",

All of the five distinct casks types used to create Edition No. 6 have been hand-picked by The Macallan Whisky Maker Steven Bremner. He drew inspiration from unique stories related to the river and surrounding landscape. The American and European oak casks have been selected to create a flavour profile that will deliver a multifaceted experience; from the appealing rich brass natural colour, to the layers of aroma, followed by the deep and rewarding flavour. The legendary River Spey flows through the Estate and is globally renowned as a home to the mighty Atlantic salmon. The Macallan Ghillie is a custodian of the River Spey and advocate for sustaining the wildlife in and around it. On our one-and-three-quarter mile stretch of river, a fortunate few can test their skills in the hope of catching – and releasing – wild Atlantic salmon using Hardy’s incomparable tackle. Wild Atlantic salmon are at risk of becoming an endangered species. Therefore The Macallan are working with the Atlantic Salmon Trust to help raise awareness of this, and to support vital conservation work on the River Spey and beyond.\"",

Aged for around 9 years and bottled at 90.4 proof (45.2% ABV), this bourbon replaces most of the rye with oats, resulting in a rich and innovative flavor profile. It presents a damp, golden sand appearance and offers a robust nose with notes of rich oak, vanilla, caramel, and faint citrus and leather. On the palate, it delivers prominent grain notes, including the oat, with more oak, vanilla, and citrus, providing a decent mouthfeel. The finish is long and musty, with lingering oak, oat, and citrus flavors, making it a standout in the Master's Collection series and a testament to the innovative spirit of Master Distiller Chris Morris and Assistant Master Distiller Elizabeth McCall.

It's referred to as a premier bourbon that stands the test of time. It has an alcohol volume of 50.5%, which translates to 101 proof.\n\nThis bourbon was distinguished by its \"Cheesy Gold Foil\" labeling, a term used by bourbon communities to refer to this particular release. Among the Wild Turkey 101 12-year releases of the 1990s, the CGF variety is highly valued when compared to the \"Split Label\" variety from later in the decade. The CGF bottles tend to be valued more highly due to their iconic label and perhaps the quality of the bourbon itself.\n\nIt's described as a fantastic pour with a perfect combination of sweetness and oak. This blend of flavors is often what bourbon enthusiasts seek, making it a beloved choice among many.\n\nThis bourbon has become a collectible item over time due to its exceptional quality and the nostalgia associated with its release era.",

The Old Grand-Dad line is in honor of the iconic Meredith Basil Hayden, Sr., commonly referred to as Basil Hayden. He was born on Wednesday January 2, 1743 in St. Mary’s, Maryland to George Hayden, Sr. (1715-July 10, 1754) and Charity Mary Morgan (1718- October 3, 1791). Basil’s family immigrated to the United States from England in the 1660’s, fleeing the religious intolerance for Catholics at that time in their country. In their effort to find refuge, his ancestors found home in St. Mary’s, Maryland which later became the birthplace of Basil himself. He married Henrietta Cole (born July 2, 1754) in 1771 and together they had fifteen children. Nearly a century after the great emigration, in 1785 Basil continued in the faith of his ancestors by leading a congregation of Catholics through the tough journey of hundreds of rugged miles from Maryland to Nelson County, Kentucky. During the time of this journey, Basil and Henrietta had already given birth to nine of their fifteen children, but unfortunately four of them passed away during the perils of the journey to Kentucky. Once the congregation reached the Kentucky lands, they settled and formed farm lands. Henrietta and Basil went on to birth six more children in the Kentucky settlement. Here Basil began small scale distilling in 1788 and was known for using higher rye content in his mash bill than what was typically being used by other distillers of the time. He continued distilling until his death on Sunday July 15, 1804 in Washington County, Kentucky.",

Matured for 13 years in charred oak barrels, this bourbon offers a complex flavor profile with notes of caramel, vanilla, warm spices, toasted nuts, dried fruit, and leather, providing a smooth and velvety texture that makes it a favorite among connoisseurs[1]. The Old Kentucky No. 88 is not only a testament to the rich heritage of American bourbon but also a collector's item due to its historical significance and the craftsmanship involved in its production.

Distilled in 1938 this 45 year old single malt could have been sourced from a number of distilleries in Scotland as Gordon & Macphail purchased spirit from right across the country. The firm operated as the bottler for many distilleries who either did not have the facilities or desire to bottle their product as a single malt. Hence a few suggestions such as Linkwood, Mortlach, Glen Grant, Macallan, Glenlivet or Glenfarclas can be made as G&M routinely held deep vintage stocks of these Speyside distilleries. This 45 year old comes from the Book Of Kells series, a label inspired by the medieval manuscript.",

This is the third barrel of Blanton’s they have selected, and we’re honored to have a bottle to explore and share with our readers.   This particular barrel could be best described in a single word: balanced. It touches on all the right flavor notes one might come to expect from Blanton’s, a little oak, honey, caramel, raisin, hints of spice, and some savory notes. The whiskey doesn’t veer too far in any one direction, which makes it an ideal sipper and representative of the Original Single Barrel brand.

Its relationship with the former, lead to a three decade-long association with London wine-merchants, Berry Brothers & Rudd, who first approached Highland Distillers about licensing the Glenrothes single malt brand in 1983, eventually trading the Cutty Sark blend with Edrington for full ownership of it in 2010. The distillery itself remained with Edrington through, and the two were reunited when the now hugely successful brand was returned in 2017.

    "description": "A very very popular label throughout the 20th century, Kentucky Tavern was the flagship brand from Glenmore distillers out of Owensboro.\n\nGlenmore would grow into a thriving business throughout the 1900s, with its founder, James Thompson, emigrating from Ireland to the US in 1871. He originally started work with the precursor firm to Brown-Forman, before eventually acquiring the Monarch distillery in 1901 and renaming it Glenmore.\n\nThompson made his brother-in-law, H.S. Barton the the master distiller of Glenmore and they produced their whiskey even through prohibition, being one of just six granted a license.\n\nIn 1944 the firm acquired Yellowstone and built the brand alongside Kentucky Tavern to be some of the most highly praised premium bourbons of the era.\n\nKentucky Tavern was typically bottled as an 8 year old product, so this 15 year bottling produced under the ownership of James Thompson and its first master distiller is exceptionally special!",

This offering showcases the full potential of individual barrels, bottled at a robust 107 proof (53.5% ABV) without chill filtration. As a single barrel selection, each bottle represents the unique characteristics of its source barrel, providing a one-of-a-kind tasting experience that can vary subtly between selections.\n\nTypically chosen by retailers, bars, or whiskey clubs, Weller Antique 107 Single Barrel Select allows connoisseurs to explore the nuances of Buffalo Trace's wheated bourbon mashbill at its full, uncut strength. While not age-stated, these selections are generally aged for about 6 years, developing a complex flavor profile that balances the sweetness of wheat with the depth of well-aged bourbon.\n\nThe Antique 107 expression is particularly prized for its intensity and rich mouthfeel, offering a more robust experience compared to other Weller offerings. Its high proof and lack of chill filtration preserve the bourbon's natural oils and flavor compounds, resulting in a full-bodied whiskey that showcases the distillery's craftsmanship. Often described as the \"Goldilocks\" of the Weller lineup, Antique 107 strikes a balance between age, proof, and price point.\n\nDue to its limited availability and the reputation of the Weller brand, Weller Antique 107 Single Barrel Select has become highly sought after by bourbon enthusiasts, often commanding premium prices and generating significant excitement when released. The single barrel format highlights the nuances in flavor that can occur between barrels, offering an opportunity to explore the depth and variety within the Weller profile.\n",

The leather case includes 25 saddle stitches to represent each year of maturation.  One of Yamazaki’s greatest and rarest releases as only 100 bottles of this were ever made.",

Adolph Hirsch commissioned 400 barrels to be filled by Michter's master distiller Dick Stoll. These barrels were left to mature in Pennsylvania until Michter's shut its doors in the 1980s. The stocks were purchased by liquor legend Gordon Hue, who then contracted Julian Van Winkle to bottle the barrels. A number of different versions of this 400 barrel batch were released, some with wax tops and a hand-full exclusive to the Japanese market. The stocks eventually changed hands. This is the bourbon heralded by Chuck Cowdery as \"The best bourbon you'll never try\" in his book. The mythos of the Michter's pot still product has become legend and resulted in this 1974 batch being amongst the most sought after bourbon.",

Like so many other distilleries, Peerless ceased production in 1917 due to the passing of the 18thAmendment, Prohibition. The company lay dormant for more than 100 years until Mr. Kravers great grandson, Corky Taylor, had an idea and vision to revitalize his family’s brand. In 2014, Kentucky Peerless Distilling Co. began reconstruction on an old building in the heart of Whiskey Row in Louisville, KY where the distillery can be visited by tourists today. On March 15th, 2015, for the first time since 1917, Kentucky Peerless Distilling Co. was back to be a fully operational brand, filling the first barrel since the company went out of business almost 100 years before. Today, Peerless produces Rye and Bourbon whiskey, with their Rye whiskey receiving high remarks from Whiskey Advocate and being named in the top 20 whiskeys of the year in 2017.",

    "description": "Released in June 2011 Ardbeg Alligator takes its name from the aggressive charring of the American casks the whisky was matured in. This charring level is known as the Alligator char because the cracking of the wood under the heat looks similar to the skin of an Alligator. The Ardberg Distillery lies on the most Southernly part of Islay and on the rugged shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Ardberg is revered around the world as the peatiest smokiest most complex whisky of them all. Yet it does not flaunt the peat: rather the peat gives way to the malt the natural sweetness of which subtly intrudes producing perfect balance.",

Created for connoisseurs familiar with cask strength whiskeys, this enormous taste profile reaches depths of flavor found only in the rarest of spirits. On the nose we get notes of dark chocolate, caramel and butter with earthy undertones of walnut and hazelnut.  The palate delivers intrepid notes of warm vanilla, oak, toasted nuts and a rich spiciness with hints of butterscotch or honey.  The high alcohol by volume is intense and powerful yet inviting. The deep and resonate finish on this bourbon is nothing short of legendary. Straight from the barrel is best served neat or with a splash of water. Un-filtered, un-cut, unbelievable. ",

One of the damaged warehouses was Warehouse C a treasured warehouse on property built by Colonel Edmund Haynes Taylor Jr. in 1885. It sustained significant damage to its roof and north brick wall exposing a group of aging bourbon barrels to the elements. That summer the exposed barrels waited patiently while the roof and walls were repaired meanwhile being exposed to the Central Kentucky climate. When these barrels were tasted years later it was discovered that the sun wind and elements they had experienced created a bourbon rich in flavors that was unmatched. This was truly a special batch of barrels and though the Distillery does not hope for another tornado it feels lucky to have been able to release this once in a lifetime product.",

    "description": "The 1980s Wild Turkey bourbon bottled in a 375ml format represents a unique and collectible expression from a pivotal era in the distillery's history. This smaller bottle size, often referred to as a \"half-pint\" or \"flask\" size, offers a compact yet potent representation of Wild Turkey's craftsmanship during this period.\n\nTypically bottled at the iconic 101 proof (50.5% ABV), this 375ml Wild Turkey from the 1980s showcases the rich, robust flavor profile that the brand became renowned for under Master Distiller Jimmy Russell's guidance. The nose likely presents a harmonious blend of classic bourbon notes - vanilla, caramel, and oak - complemented by the signature Wild Turkey spice and hints of leather and tobacco. On the palate, enthusiasts might expect a full-bodied experience with flavors of butterscotch, dark fruits, and a pronounced spiciness characteristic of Wild Turkey's high-rye mashbill. The finish would likely be long and warming, with lingering notes of oak, vanilla, and a touch of medicinal cherry - a hallmark of Wild Turkey from this era. While the 375ml size might be smaller, it doesn't diminish the complexity and depth of the bourbon inside. These bottles are particularly prized by collectors not only for their compact size but also as representations of Wild Turkey's quality during a time when aged stocks were plentiful and the bourbon industry was on the cusp of significant changes.\n",

    "description": "User Review:\nNose: Meaty and nutty notes immediately. Dark, lean, raw red meat. Caramelized molasses. Pepper. Leather. Walnuts. Malty nose; smells like this is going to be heavy and syrupy. Floral notes are heavy too; like pressed flower petals, or some kind of extract. A powdered chocolate weaves into the rye spice. Slight graininess. I want this to be sweeter, but the heavy meatiness is still lingering. Wait... Suddenly things are lighter. Actual cotton now mixing with a sweet cotton candy. What just happened? It's like I'm smelling a completely different whiskey now. I swear it can't be, because I haven't put this glass down yet. Caramel and vanilla are now here to party. A bright, shining singular cherry is being displayed. Better experience than I've previously had with this. Maybe it needed a longer rest time. Slight tannic note like I've experienced out of a madeira finish comes out late. Ok, finally (!) there is a hint of marshmallow I was hoping for on the toasted barrel. It has evolved very well in the glass, with the later scents being more enjoyable than the early ones. A dusty old oak that reminds me of my grandmother's attic I would play in as a kid.\n\n\nPalate: Instant syrupy plum mouth coating that also thins quickly, leaving caramel and a bright linen / citrus. The spice of cinnamon and allspice are well checked by these lighter flavors. A good chew reveals much more hot cherry and clove. After a few sips it falls a little flat; while the finish is very long & lingering it just feels like a sting with little flavor coming along with it. Very drying, I can feel my tongue start to become abrasive against my gums. With how the initial nosing went, I was expecting a lot of different things that did not transfer to the palate. The citrus has been a constant, but the parts of this pour that I really enjoy are so fleeting. There one moment, gone the next. A rollercoaster pour to say the least. With how hit or miss a glass of this is for me, I am going to air on the side of caution and give this one the lower end of the two ratings it has received from me in several reviews. The nose is really fun but I am always left confused on tastings. ",

    "description": "Blanton's Takara Red is a special edition of the celebrated Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon, exclusively released for the Japanese market. Part of the Takara series, which also includes Takara Black and Takara Gold, this expression is highly sought after by bourbon enthusiasts and collectors around the world.\n\nTakara Red is distinguished by its unique characteristics, including an aging process that is rumored to be a minimum of eight years, although this is not officially confirmed on the label. It is bottled at 93 proof (46.5% ABV), the same as the standard Blanton's Single Barrel, ensuring a robust flavor profile.\n\nThe packaging of Takara Red adds to its allure, featuring a distinctive red box with a woven texture and a deep maroon bag that contrasts with the brown bag of domestic Blanton's. The bottle is adorned with a gold-colored wax seal, similar to that found on Blanton's Straight From The Barrel. The label showcases light brown handwritten and printed portions, along with Japanese script spelling out \"Whiskey,\" further emphasizing its exclusivity.\n\nThe Takara Red series is particularly interesting for collectors due to its limited availability and the variations that can arise from individual barrel selections. Some special releases within this series, such as the HBA (Hotel Barmen Association Japan) Single Barrel picks, offer even more unique expressions.\n\nWhile many enthusiasts speculate about the potential superiority of the Takara series due to its rumored longer aging process, recent reviews suggest that modern releases may be more comparable in quality to standard Blanton's. Nevertheless, Takara Red remains a highly coveted expression in the bourbon world, often commanding premium prices on the secondary market.",

Named after the Noe family home in Bardstown, Kentucky, this release pays homage to the rich history and traditions of the Beam family. Aged for 7 years, 2 months, and 22 days, this bourbon is bottled at a potent cask strength of 62.3% ABV (124.6 proof).\n\nThe nose of The Beam House Batch is powerful and inviting, offering a complex array of aromas. Rich notes of caramel, vanilla, and peanut brittle are complemented by hints of dried fruit, particularly caramel apple and raisin. There's also a subtle touch of charred oak and a whisper of brûléed sugar, creating an enticing bouquet that beckons you to take a sip.\n\nOn the palate, this Booker's release delivers a bold yet surprisingly balanced experience. The high proof is evident but not overwhelming, allowing the rich flavors to shine through. Intense caramel and toffee notes lead the charge, followed by layers of brown butter, vanilla cake, and butterscotch. The signature Beam nuttiness is present but not dominant, harmonizing well with the sweeter elements. As the bourbon develops on the tongue, spice notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and black pepper emerge, adding depth and complexity to the profile.\n\nThe finish is long and satisfying, with the interplay of sweet and spicy notes lingering pleasantly. Oak tannins provide a gentle dryness that balances the residual sweetness, while hints of leather and tobacco add a sophisticated touch to the conclusion. The Beam House Batch showcases the craftsmanship and heritage of Booker's Bourbon, offering a full-flavored and nuanced drinking experience that will delight bourbon enthusiasts and collectors alike.\n\n",

At that time, they experimented with different sherry casks and then decided to use European Oloroso casks, in which the world-famous Spanish liqueur wine had previously been seasoned. Despite the crisis in the 1980s among sherry producers, the Speyside distillery Macallan managed to secure a supply of selected sherry casks and to continue bottling the coveted sherry cask matured whiskies.",

Bottled at a lower proof of 80 (40% ABV), this expression is particularly popular in international markets and is not typically available in the United States.\n\nCreated to cater to those new to single barrel bourbons or those who prefer a milder flavor profile, Blanton's Special Reserve maintains the brand's commitment to quality and craftsmanship. Like its higher-proof counterparts, it is aged in Warehouse H at Buffalo Trace Distillery, the same warehouse favored by Colonel Albert B. Blanton.\n\nThe Special Reserve offers a softer, more delicate flavor profile compared to the Original Single Barrel. It features a slightly floral nose with subtle hints of cedar and raisin. On the palate, drinkers can expect a smooth, easy-drinking bourbon with notes of vanilla, caramel, and light oak, balanced by a gentle spiciness.\n\nWhile it may not have the intensity of other Blanton's expressions, the Special Reserve is valued for its accessibility and smooth character. It's presented in the iconic Blanton's bottle, complete with the signature horse and jockey stopper, making it a sought-after addition for collectors and bourbon enthusiasts, especially those outside the United States.\nom/review/blantons-special-reserve",

    "name": "Golden Wedding 1898 Old Rye Whiskey 1914 Bottling",
    "description": "A stunning 19th century vintage rye whiskey distilled in 1898 at the Joseph S. Finch distillery in Pennsylvania. This batch of rye whiskey was purchased from bond in 1903 before being bottled in 1914 by C.A. Van Rensselaer & Co in New York. Golden Wedding is a historic label that started before prohibition and has been resurrected by Buffalo Trace in recent years. \n\nJoseph S. Finch distillery was built in 1856 just outside of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and the Golden Wedding trademark was officially reigstered in 1884. In nearby Schenley, Pennsylvania Henry Bischoff and his partners the Sinclaires built the Schenley distillery in 1892. The Schenley site would be closed in 1918 before it was later bought by D.K. Weiskopf & Lewis Rosenstiel, the pair creating Schenley Products Company. With prohibition looming the Finch distillery applied for and was granted one of the very limited licenses to create medicinal whiskey. In 1924 Sol Rosenbloom, the owner of the Joseph S. Finch distillery sold the site to Schenley products. This would be the catalyst for Schenley growing into a behemoth of 20th century distilling, acquiring distilleries like George T Stagg, Ross & Squibb and Old Oscar Pepper. \n\nThe history becomes slightly more blurry into the 20th century as one source states the Joseph S. Finch distillery was left to rot after the sale of its license, with all Pennsylvania distilled products now being made at the Schenley site. Another source suggests the original Finch distillery was simply renamed to the Schenley distillery, and that it survived until Lews Rosenstiel's death in the late 1960s. \n\nEither way Schenley Products were well positioned for prohibition thanks to the 10,000 barrels of Golden Wedding rye whiskey acquired as part of the Finch sale as well as the license to continue distilling. They continued the Golden Wedding brand after prohibition was lifted but as the market shifted to lighter styles of whiskey it was soon an American blended whiskey, with approximately 70% of the blend just neutral grain spirit. The brand was also used for young Canadian distilled whiskey by Schenley and this steep decline in quality all but destroyed its reputation. \n\nIn late 2023 Buffalo Trace resurrected the rye grain Golden Wedding brand as a 375ml bottling of 107 proof rye whiskey produced at their Frankfort distillery in Kentucky.",

Bottled at a lower proof of 80 (40% ABV), this expression is particularly popular in international markets and is not typically available in the United States.\n\nCreated to cater to those new to single barrel bourbons or those who prefer a milder flavor profile, Blanton's Special Reserve maintains the brand's commitment to quality and craftsmanship. Like its higher-proof counterparts, it is aged in Warehouse H at Buffalo Trace Distillery, the same warehouse favored by Colonel Albert B. Blanton.\n\nThe Special Reserve offers a softer, more delicate flavor profile compared to the Original Single Barrel. It features a slightly floral nose with subtle hints of cedar and raisin. On the palate, drinkers can expect a smooth, easy-drinking bourbon with notes of vanilla, caramel, and light oak, balanced by a gentle spiciness.\n\nWhile it may not have the intensity of other Blanton's expressions, the Special Reserve is valued for its accessibility and smooth character. It's presented in the iconic Blanton's bottle, complete with the signature horse and jockey stopper, making it a sought-after addition for collectors and bourbon enthusiasts, especially those outside the United States.\n\n",

Although no bottling date is given for this release a number of 1911 batch Pendennis club bottles have been produced and the lack of medicinal notes or tax stamps suggest this was likely bottled prior to prohibition. It also cannot be guaranteed if 1911 is the vintage or bottling era as these bottles were produced as personal offerings for members, so minimal information about vintage or proof were given.

In 1984, Master Distiller Elmer T.

This edition is characterized by its lower proof and extended aging process, which differentiates it from other Blanton's expressions. The Black Edition was designed to provide a smoother and more approachable experience, aligning with the flavor profiles favored in Japanese whisky culture.\n\nBlanton's has become one of the most sought-after bourbons globally, celebrated for its unique packaging and consistent quality.

On the nose, it typically presents a harmonious blend of caramel, vanilla, and toasted oak, complemented by hints of dried fruit, leather, and the signature Wild Turkey spice. The palate delivers a full-bodied experience with flavors of butterscotch, dark cherry, and maple syrup, balanced by notes of cinnamon, nutmeg, and a touch of tobacco. The 8-year aging process in heavily charred American oak barrels imparts a noticeable maturity and depth, resulting in a smooth yet complex sip. The finish is long and warming, with lingering notes of vanilla, spice, and a subtle oakiness that doesn't overwhelm. This early 2000s bottling is particularly valued by enthusiasts and collectors, as it represents a time just before significant changes in the bourbon industry led to the phasing out of many age-stated expressions.

The palate presents a better-than-average grain focus and viscosity, evolving into an off-dry profile with intense breakfast cereal and biscuit-like flavors. The finish is described as oily/creamy with a snack cracker-like quality.\n\nLaunched in 2005 with the slogan \"Success Distilled,\" this vodka was initially promoted as a luxury brand aimed at competing with established premium vodkas. However, despite its initial fanfare, Trump Vodka was discontinued in the United States in 2011 due to poor sales performance.

    "description": "Booker's \"Apprentice Batch\" is the second release in the 2023 Booker's Bourbon Collection, paying homage to the early days of Booker Noe's career at Jim Beam Distillery. This small batch bourbon is named in honor of Booker's apprenticeship under his cousin and mentor, Carl Beam, who guided him in the art of bourbon-making starting in 1952.\n\nBottled at a robust 125.5 proof (62.75% ABV), Apprentice Batch is aged for 7 years, 1 month, and 2 days. True to Booker's tradition, it is uncut and unfiltered, allowing the full flavor profile to shine through. The batch is a blend of barrels from six different warehouses, showcasing the complexity that comes from varied aging locations within the distillery.\n\nTasting notes for Apprentice Batch typically include a rich nose with aromas of caramel, vanilla, and oak, complemented by hints of fruit and spice. On the palate, it offers a full-bodied experience with flavors of brown sugar, toasted nuts, and leather, balanced by a warm, spicy finish characteristic of high-proof bourbons.\n\nAs with all Booker's releases, Apprentice Batch is a limited edition, highly sought after by bourbon enthusiasts for its bold flavor profile and the story it tells about Booker Noe's journey in bourbon-making. It represents both a tribute to tradition and a showcase of the quality and craftsmanship that defines the Booker's brand.\n\n",

Rich caramel and vanilla notes mingle with fresh orchard fruits, particularly apple and peach. There's an intriguing undercurrent of baked bread and licorice, adding depth and complexity to the olfactory experience.\n\nThe palate is bold and flavorful, with an initial burst of sweetness from honey and caramel. This is quickly followed by layers of cinnamon, nutmeg, and black pepper spice. The high rye content shines through, providing a pleasant herbal quality and a touch of grassiness. Despite its relative youth, the bourbon displays a surprising fruitiness and depth of flavor.\n\nIt offers a full-bodied mouthfeel with a pleasant warmth that doesn't overwhelm. The finish is long and satisfying, with lingering notes of oak, vanilla, and a subtle hint of dark chocolate.\n\nWilderness Trail Single Barrel Bourbon demonstrates the distillery's expertise in fermentation and distillation, resulting in a whiskey that punches above its age. It offers bourbon enthusiasts a chance to experience a meticulously crafted, unique expression of Kentucky bourbon that balances traditional flavors with innovative production methods.",

    "description": "W.L. Weller Single Barrel is a premium expression from the renowned Weller line of wheated bourbons, produced by Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort, Kentucky. Introduced in 2020, this release expanded the Weller portfolio, offering bourbon enthusiasts a single barrel experience of the beloved wheated recipe. Bottled at a consistent 97 proof (48.5% ABV), this expression strikes a balance between approachability and intensity, showcasing the unique characteristics of individual barrels.\n\nEach bottle of W.L. Weller Single Barrel comes from a single, hand-selected barrel, ensuring a unique tasting experience that can vary subtly between selections. While not age-stated, the bourbon is typically aged for several years, allowing it to develop complexity while maintaining the smooth, wheat-forward profile that Weller is known for. The single barrel format highlights the nuances in flavor that can occur between barrels, offering connoisseurs the opportunity to explore the depth of Weller's craftsmanship.\n\nNamed after William Larue Weller, who pioneered the use of wheat instead of rye in the bourbon mash bill, this expression continues his legacy of producing smooth, flavorful whiskey. W.L. Weller Single Barrel has quickly become a sought-after bottle among bourbon enthusiasts, praised for its rich flavor profile and the unique experience it offers with each barrel selection. Its limited availability and connection to the highly regarded Weller lineage have cemented its status as a prized addition to many whiskey collections.\n",

    "description": "Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage 2008, bottled in 2016, is a distinguished expression from Heaven Hill Distillery that showcases the art of single barrel bourbon production. As the only vintage-dated single barrel bourbon on the market, this release offers a unique tasting experience that captures a specific moment in time.\n\nDistilled in 2008 and aged for approximately 8 years before bottling in 2016, this bourbon has developed a complex flavor profile during its maturation in American white oak barrels. Bottled at 86.6 proof (43.3% ABV), it strikes a balance between flavor intensity and approachability.\n\nOn the nose, this vintage likely presents aromas of caramel, vanilla, and oak, complemented by hints of dried fruits and subtle spices. The palate may offer flavors of honey, toasted nuts, and cinnamon, with undertones of leather and tobacco. The finish is expected to be smooth and lingering, with a pleasant warmth and notes of oak and sweet corn.\n\nEach bottle of Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage is marked with the date it was put into oak, the bottling year, and the exact barrel number, allowing enthusiasts to trace the bourbon's journey from grain to glass. This attention to detail and transparency has made the Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage series a favorite among bourbon connoisseurs and collectors alike.\n\n",

From the day she was born, she would be the owner of the Springbank cask 409. However, she wouldn’t be allowed to have access to the cask until she turned 21 years old.  After the whisky was able to ripen in the cask for 24 years, she decided to take further action with this unique product.

    "name": "Johnnie Walker Oldest '90s",
    "description": "The history of Blue Label can be drawn back further than its official release in 1992. Johnnie Walker’s Oldest pays more than a passing resemblance to what would go on to become one of the world’s most famous whiskies. And indeed, the makeup of this forerunner expression, noted as containing whiskies aged up to 60 years, and rumoured to included liquids from DCL’s (the forerunner to Diageo) distilleries Port Ellen and Brora have led to persistent rumours about the actual composition of Blue Label decades later– most of which increasingly don’t stand up to scrutiny.\n\nThe development of Blue Label is alleged to have stemmed from Alexander Walker’s (son of Johnnie Walker) “Old Highland Whisky” created in 1867 whose composition contained whiskies from “the four corners of Scotland”. A romantic notion for a product released over 100 years later, but still holding some water given the diversity of Diageo’s distillery portfolio and its geographic disparity.\n\nYou’ll already have noted that this Blue Label – named “Highest Awards” due to the text listing a selection of competition wins (the expression wasn’t always quite so well known) – is bottled at 43% ABV. This is not a one-off aberration similar to some of the ‘Casks Editions’ of Blue Label that are also offered at a higher (considerably) ABV. No – back in the day, Johnnie Walker Blue Label was simply bottled at this slightly higher alcoholic strength – likely as a market differential to the other JW bottles within the range.\n\nNose: White grapes and green apple slices sit alongside crunchy toffee. Developing in the glass, dry earthiness, tobacco leaf and rose petals present together with sunflower oil and touch of dried mango.\n\nTaste: Holds its stated ABV well with a selection of waxes and oils, all of which provide body and structure. Antique orange liqueurs and cinnamon spiced toffee are joined by old style sherry, sour pineapple chunks and sponge. The mid and back palate brings additional oakiness together with a citric pang and shaving of stem ginger.\n\nFinish: Medium in length with a selection of syrupy tinned fruits and drying, somewhat tannic wood.\n\nCompared to its present-day manifestation, this 90s Blue Label feels less refined and polished. But what is lacks in elegance, it more than makes up with in character. Vibrancy, structure and cohesion are offered alongside occasional welcome asides into either the distillate base or cask constituents. And whilst none of this feels particularly intricate it still manages to offer a uniqueness that has been either lost or deliberately discarded from this bottling over the decades. The additional 3% ABV doesn’t feel significantly more generous in the mouth than the current day Blue Label – however the malt base most certainly includes weightier elements which really ground the expression in terms of its ‘feel’ – never anything less than “smooth”, but with plenty of presence throughout.",

Matured for 28 years in an American white oak cask it was bottled in 2010 at 61% Abv with 352 bottles produced.\n\nNestled amidst Japan's majestic Southern Alps and the towering Central Alps, Mars Shinshu stands as the nation's loftiest whisky distillery, perched over 2,600 feet above sea level. With over a century of distilling heritage, the Hombo family expanded their craft to include whisky in 1949. Originally situated in Kagoshima Prefecture on Kyushu, Mars Shinshu held the distinction of producing Japan's southernmost whisky until 1984, when the Hombo clan relocated the distillery to the serene alpine landscapes of Miyada village in southern Nagano Prefecture.\n\nThe move to Miyada was strategic, capitalizing on the region's cooler temperatures, which fostered a slower maturation process, and its abundant, soft, granite-filtered snowmelt-fed aquifers. This idyllic setting provided the perfect conditions for crafting exceptional whisky. Mars Shinshu's whiskies are renowned for their elegance, smoothness, and remarkable complexity, a testament to the distillery's unwavering commitment to quality and craftsmanship. \n\nKomagatake whiskies embody the essence of Japan's whisky-making tradition. With their distinct character and impeccable quality, Komagatake whiskies offer a captivating journey through Japan's rich whisky heritage.",

While not typically labeled as a single malt—except on rare occasions when it exhibits its robust, meaty character—Benrinnes offers independent bottlers like Cadenhead an ideal canvas for showcasing distilleries.  Interestingly, Benrinnes' current location is its second incarnation. The original distillery, constructed in 1826 by Peter MacKenzie, fell victim to a devastating flood in 1829. John Innes later discovered and established the distillery's current site.",

    "description": "\nOne of the rare rums in the world to boast a terroir, the sugar cane for this rum—spelled rhum in French—is cultivated in a distinctive microclimate, nestled in volcanic soil on the slopes of Mt. Pelee. Situated on a sloping field with low cloud cover and caressed by sea breezes, this locale is a stark departure from the typical flat lands and poor soils where most sugarcane is grown. Much akin to the revered houses of Bordeaux, Cognac, or Champagne, this single estate rum is distinguished by its unique microclimate and precisely defined geographic boundaries, imparting distinct characteristics to the final product.\n\nAnother notable feature is its classification as Rhum Agricole, crafted directly from sugar cane juice rather than molasses. Accounting for less than 5% of global rum production, this method yields a markedly different spirit. Among a series of rums, each distinguished by age, are Rhum Blanc J.M., Rhum J.M. Paille (Gold), and Rhum J.M. VSOP. This particular iteration is aged for a decade in Oak casks before being bottled, contributing to its unparalleled depth and complexity.",

    "description": "Distilled in 1916, this bourbon was protected in bond by the American Medicinal Spirits Company from the Prohibition Act of 1920, which made alcohol production and consumption illegal. The whiskey was produced at the Anderson Distillery distillery in 1916, then owned by the infamous Whiskey Trust. The Trust was accused of engaging in several illegal activities, including intimidation of distillery owners who did not want to sell up to them. They acquired Anderson by some means in 1905, but were forced to close it down with the enactment of Prohibition in 1920. The stocks from the distillery were transferred to the Wathen warehouses that year, and bottled by the American Medicinal Spirits Company. The American Medicinal Spirits Company was one of only around 30 distilling companies to survive Prohibition of the 434 that existed prior. Exploiting the medicinal loophole was the brainchild of Otto Wathen, an idea which continues to prove its value today in the persisting image of his still ever-popular portfolio, which eventually included Old Grand-dad, Old Taylor and Old Crow, among many others. The American Medicinal Spirits Company was eventually subsumed by National Distillers (the revived legitimate face of The Whiskey Trust), who along with Schenley, Hiram Walker and Seagram's, became the big 4 American whiskey companies following the eventual repeal of Prohibition. The National Distillers acquisition of the AMS Co meant the return for brands such as Old Ramshead, bottled here in 1930. Sadly, as with many others, the Anderson Distillery never returned, and was razed and never rebuilt following the repeal of Prohibition.",

This batch is aged for 6 years, 10 months, and 10 days, and bottled at a robust 122.4 proof (61.2% ABV), offering bourbon enthusiasts a full-flavored and potent expression.\n\nThe nose of Pinkie's Batch is inviting and complex, featuring a harmonious blend of brown spices and vanilla notes. As you bring the glass closer, you're greeted by rich aromas of vanilla bean, reminiscent of opening a fresh package. Warm oak notes complement the vanilla, while hints of caramel, brown sugar, and baking spices add depth to the bouquet. A subtle touch of tobacco emerges in the background, accompanied by a gentle reminder of the bourbon's high proof.\n\nOn the palate, Pinkie's Batch delivers Booker's signature vanilla flavor in full force. The initial sip floods the mouth with a sweet and rich profile, showcasing heavy caramel and generous vanilla notes. These are complemented by nuances of peanut butter and dried fruits, particularly raisins and fresh dates. The sweetness is balanced by deeper, more complex flavors of molasses or sorghum, creating a dessert-like experience. As the flavors develop, subtle notes of barrel char, tobacco, pepper, and leather emerge, adding layers of complexity to the tasting experience.\n\nThe finish is lingering and well-rounded, with the interplay of sweet and spicy notes continuing to evolve. While the mouthfeel may be slightly thinner than some previous Booker's releases, the overall experience remains satisfying and true to the brand's reputation for bold, uncut, and unfiltered bourbon. Pinkie's Batch stands as a fitting tribute to Frederick Booker Noe, offering a bourbon that both honors tradition and delivers a memorable tasting experience.\n204_pinkies_batch/",

Buttery notes mingle with toasted walnuts, creating a warm and comforting scent. Dusty oak and citrus undertones add complexity, while a powdery vanilla aroma evokes memories of freshly baked cake. As the bourbon opens up, rich cherry and dark stewed plum scents emerge, accompanied by hints of black pepper and grape tannins.\n\nOn the palate, Granny's Batch delivers an intense yet surprisingly delicate flavor profile. The initial sip brings a wave of heat, quickly followed by a thick, syrupy cherry juice note. As the bourbon develops on the tongue, creamy citrus flavors emerge, complemented by rye spice, cinnamon stick, and plum. The signature Beam peanut shell note, while present, is more subtle in this batch, allowing other flavors to shine through.\n\nThe finish is impressively long, with waves of flavor that seem to go on forever. The interplay between sweet and spicy notes continues, with lingering hints of cinnamon, vanilla, and that characteristic dusty, salted peanut shell flavor. The high proof is evident but not overwhelming, creating a warm, satisfying conclusion to each sip.\n\nGranny's Batch showcases the complexity and depth that Booker's is known for, offering a bourbon that is both powerful and nuanced. It's a fitting tribute to Booker Noe's grandmother, delivering a memorable tasting experience that bourbon enthusiasts will savor.\n\n",

This blended whisky is celebrated for its smoothness and rich flavor profile, making it one of the best-selling whiskies in North America.\n\nCrown Royal is crafted from a blend of over 50 different whiskies, each aged to perfection and meticulously selected to create a harmonious balance of flavors. The whisky is known for its signature notes of vanilla, caramel, and light oak, complemented by hints of fruit and spice. Its distinctive purple velvet bag has become iconic, symbolizing luxury and quality.\n\nInitially available only in Canada, Crown Royal was introduced to the United States in the 1960s, where it quickly gained popularity. The brand has since expanded its range to include various expressions, such as Crown Royal Reserve, Crown Royal Black, and flavored variants like Maple and Vanilla.\n\nToday, Crown Royal remains a staple in bars and homes alike, appreciated for its versatility—whether enjoyed neat, on the rocks, or as part of a cocktail.

    "name": "Chandler Gin Stewart Distilling Co Early 1900s Bottling",
    "description": "A bottling of Chandler Gin made by the Stewart Distilling Co in Philadelphia. This was bottled in the early 1900s. Robert Stewart was an Irishman who emigrated to Baltimore in the middle of the 19th century. He started his distillery in 1886 in Highlandtown and then officially incorporated his business in 1894. The firm produced \"Robert Stewart Rye\" and contracted H.B. Kirk in New York for bottling, a firm which also bottled Old Crow Rye from W.A. Gaines & Co. Robert Stewart decided to retire and sell the company in 1897 to the Carstairs of Philadelphia. In 1898, the same year this rye whiskey was produced, a news article claims the distillery had the capacity to produce 1200-1500 gallons of whiskey per day with an expansion planned to up production to 3000 gallons per day. The Carstair Brothers ran the firm themselves from 1898 until 1908 when the firm consolidated its holdings, creating the Stewart Distilling Company and merged its historical Carstairs, Mcall & Co company into one. The distillery and firm operated until 1919. As prohibition loomed the Carstairs Mcall & Co firm chose to liquidate the site, but J.H. Carstair stepped in and purchased the distillery himself. Prohibition hampered any chance of revival however and by 1921 J.H. Carstair was out of the business. The site was sold and continued to hold liquor onsite through the early years of prohibition, even having its liquid stolen by bootleggers in 1923. The moonshiners tunnelled into the distillery from a nearby empty house and pumped the whiskey out of the barrels into containers next door. In 1924 the vice president Jacob Katz of Stewart Distillery and the manager of nearby Sherwood distillery were caught selling both barrels and cases of whiskey, actions outlawed by prohibition. Finally in 1925 the distillery was put up for sale and dismantled, being fully purchased by the Crown Oil & Wax Company in 1927. This specific bottle bears no size or strength, but one has reportedly been opened and proofed as approximately 110. We estimate this to be a 4/5th quart/750ml bottle size. \n\nBaxus holds a number of these assets so please carefully inspect images for their fill level and condition.",

    "description": "Distilled in 1916, this bourbon was protected in bond by the American Medicinal Spirits Company from the Prohibition Act of 1920, which made alcohol production and consumption illegal. The whiskey was produced at the Anderson Distillery distillery in 1916, then owned by the infamous Whiskey Trust. The Trust was accused of engaging in several illegal activities, including intimidation of distillery owners who did not want to sell up to them. They acquired Anderson by some means in 1905, but were forced to close it down with the enactment of Prohibition in 1920. The stocks from the distillery were transferred to the Wathen warehouses that year, and bottled by the American Medicinal Spirits Company. The American Medicinal Spirits Company was one of only around 30 distilling companies to survive Prohibition of the 434 that existed prior. Exploiting the medicinal loophole was the brainchild of Otto Wathen, an idea which continues to prove its value today in the persisting image of his still ever-popular portfolio, which eventually included Old Grand-dad, Old Taylor and Old Crow, among many others. The American Medicinal Spirits Company was eventually subsumed by National Distillers (the revived legitimate face of The Whiskey Trust), who along with Schenley, Hiram Walker and Seagram's, became the big 4 American whiskey companies following the eventual repeal of Prohibition. The National Distillers acquisition of the AMS Co meant the return for brands such as Old Ramshead, bottled here in 1930. Sadly, as with many others, the Anderson Distillery never returned, and was razed and never rebuilt following the repeal of Prohibition.",

This expression was bottled in 1983 and thus contains over 50 year old single malt spirit.\n\nThis bottle is bottled at a cask strength of 38.6% Abv, or \"under strength\" as 40% Abv is the modern requirement for all Scotch whisky. This release saw just 500 bottles produced in a time when single malt whisky represented the smallest of fractions of the whisky market. \n\nMacallan was one of the few brands in Scotland that has been able to persevere through the troubles the 20th century brought. They have maintained steady production of exceptional quality single malt whisky through war time, economic downturns and whisky market crashes. \n\nPivoting in the early 1980s to focusing on bottling their own whisky as a single malt, this was an unheard of move with almost the entire whisky market exclusively drinking blends. The move would pay dividends for the Speyside giant as the early focus on single malt has meant highly aged stocks like this release are amongst the most treasure whiskies on the planet.",

And indeed Mr. Herb did! He walked right out to the production line, pulled the first three bottles, and sent them on their way. According to Mr. Herb, when the folks in the advertising department found out he had pulled whiskey for the competition off the bottling line, they were a bit upset and asked why he hadn’t looked for some special whiskey for the judging. To this Mr. Herb exclaimed: “Why all Jack Daniel’s is special!” The folks in Brussels seemed to agree. Jack Daniel’s was awarded its sixth Gold Medal, the 1954 Star of Excellence.",

    "name": "Gosling Brothers Barbados Falernum 1940s Bottling",
    "description": "A circa 1940s bottling of Falernum, a type of liqueur made from rum, lime and sugar. Falernum was historically produced in Barbados, although other Caribbean countries like Jamaica and Grenada have claimed origins. Falernum was typically used as a sweetening and flavouring liqueur for rum punches and cocktails of the late 1800s/early 20th century. Falernum has seen a resurgence amongst cocktail bartenders in the 21st century, with many favouring it over using standard sugar syrup or amaro. This is a circa 1940s era bottling as the glass wording imprinted in the bottle dates to 1935 at the earliest, and a similar font designed rum from Gosling Brothers was confirmed to be of circa WW2 era. This was bottled by Gosling Brothers, a Bermuda rum producer who began in 1806. The firm sourced spirits and wines for export but in 1860 they acquired their fist barrels of rum, creating the unique Gosling Black Seal blend. This brand has endured and is still today a widespread label containing blended Caribbean rums that are vatted on the island of Bermuda. As the Gosling Brothers firm acted as a supplier of wines & spirits it is therefore reasonable to assume they were also sourcing Falernum from Barbados to sell alongside their rums. Although no size or Abv is declared for this bottle we expect it to be an approx 750ml sized bottle, and likely a rough Abv of 15-25% Abv as was common for Falernum at the time.",

    "description": "A 1910s-1920s era vintage of Bacardi Carta Blanca Superior distilled by the Bacardi family at their Santiago de Cuba distilleries. The brand was founded in 1862 by Facundo Bacardi Masso, a Catalonian merchant who opened two distilleries to create both a light and heavy style of rum. His blended rum was a huge hit and allowed Facundo to purchase more and more distilleries, expanding further into Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Bacardi family held the firm until the company was seized by Fidel Castro in 1959 amid the Cuban Revolution. As the nation began nationalising industry, Bacardi moved its headquarters and continued production in Puerto Rico, Brazil, Spain, Canada and Mexico. This stunning bottle was produced prior to the introduction of prohibition in 1920 as it makes reference to their New York headquarters, which was closed amid nationwide prohibition. On the rear of the bottle is an Acker Merrall wine merchants (today Acker wine auctions) sticker noting tax has been paid as of 1913, thus this bottle is likely from the mid 1910s until the late 1920s. Of note are the bubbles visible in the glass, suggesting this was a hand blown glass bottle and likely therefore dates towards the earlier range as machine moulded glass became more prevalent throughout this decade. A wonderful old bottling of Cuban rum produced in their Santiago de Cuba homeland by the Bacardi family, likely during the first world war.",

This era of Pepper bourbon was crafted at their distillery post prohibition in 1934. The Pepper family had been operating sizeable distilleries in Kentucky for generations, but when James died in 1906 his wife sold the Lexington location to a group of investors. The site operated until 1917 and was then granted a license to bottle stocks through prohibition. A fire in 1933 raised the old distillery, once known as the Henry Clay distillery, to the ground. Once prohibition was lifted the large liquor giant Schenley would come knocking, and in 1934 they purchased Old Oscar Pepper. Production was strained with World War II demanding ethanol be generated for the war effort over whiskey. Even post war Schenley suffered and in 1958 they closed the James E. Pepper distillery. This is a rare post war vintage of bourbon from the Lexington distillery which was bottled in bond at 50% Abv in 1950. The decanter used for this release has since been replicated by the new James E. Pepper distillery which sits on the same Lexington site. ",

Stagg distillery in Frankfort. The Carlisle distillery was a sister distillery to George T. Stagg's Old Copper Fire Distillery and was located just 1 mile away. Details are exceptionally thin on this distillery, with no clear closure date available but the last recorded transaction for the George T. Stagg's involvement with Carlisle is dated 1920. As this coincides with prohibition it is likely Carlisle closed around this time. This pint bottling was produced by Albert Blanton at the Carlisle distillery for Schenley and bottled during prohibition.",

    "description": "A 1959 vintage expression of bourbon bottled under the historic Old Underoof brand. Bottled in bond at 50% Abv in 1969 this 6 year age stated bourbon was ultimately matured over 10 years. Produced at the Bonds Mill distillery DSP KY 35 in Lawrenceburg, this release was bottled at DSP 1 Bernheim by Schenley who held the distillery at the time. Bonds Mill was opened in 1934 on the site of the original Old Prentice distillery. This location was just opposite Old Joe Distillery, the Spanish architecture inspired distillery that would later become Four Roses Lawrenceburg. Bonds Mill was was built by Robert E. Johnson, a businessman who's lineage had produced bourbon in Lawrenceburg for the Saffell Distilling co, a storied firm in the area. They initially purchased spirit from the Old Joe distillery on the other side of the road, before fully producing their own spirits under the Bonds Mill label. The distillery was named Bond & Johnson in 1945 and then eventually purchased by Robert and Alvin Gould in 1958. The Goulds used the Bonds Mill site to create whiskey for their J.T.S. Brown label they held. They would ultimately sell the site to Schenley who acquired the existing stocks before ultimately closing production in the late 1960s. The existing warehouses were sold to Wild Turkey. \n\nThis 1969 release was bottled at the Bernheim distillery owned by Schenley under the Old Underoof branding. Underoof was a brand heavily associated with Chas. Dennehy & Co of Chiacgo. Dennehy was a partnership between Charles Dennehy and two individuals named Weadley & Cleary. The firm sourced rye and bourbon whiskies from across the US, producing house brands such as Old Potter and Clear Spring. Their Old Underoof brand was the most popular and was launched in 1905. When Charles died his son Thomas Dennehy took over the firm, actively fighting against the questionably illegal Whiskey Trust who were trying to monopolise whiskey making in the United States. The firm was ultimately closed in 1918 as a consequence of looming prohibition, but the resurrection of its Old Underoof brand by Schenley in the 1960s suggests the firm may have acquired Dennehy's brands.

Prohibition shuttered their operations but the brand was acquired by National Distillers who initially produced it, before later selling the label to Schenley.  This era of the brand was produced under the ownership of Schenley and notes having both Frankfort and Bardstown distilleries. It is believed the distilleries referenced are the Fairfield distillery in Bardstown as well as George T Stagg in Frankfort. This is either produced at one of those distilleries, or a blend of both.

This pre-castro era bottling features a logo design used from 1954-1962 and was exported to the US market. Havana Club was the English brand name produced by Don Jose Arechabala who purchased the La Vizcaya distillery in Cardenas in 1878. Once prohibition in the states ended the Jose Arechabala company launched Havana Club to target the American market, with both the brand and distillery remaining in family hands until the 1950s. In 1959 Cuba revolted and Fidel Castro took power, nationalising much of the country's industrial production including the sugar and thereby rum industry. The Arechabala family fled the country, leaving their distillery in the hands of the Castro government. The US shortly after introduced restrictions for Cuban made rums, thus little of Havana Club was able to make it into the United States throughout the later 20th century. Cuba and French spirits firm Pernod Ricard partnered in 1993 to distribute the rum globally, and Havana Club has become a staple sugar cane spirit for rum lovers across the world. This 1950s era bottling was produced in the pre-Castro era of the distillery, when it was by the Arechabala family and the brand was poised to be the next big thing in the US. To provide further estimation to the bottling date the tax stamp from this bottling is commonly estimated to be from 1961, however it is unclear if this design was used earlier by imported products, and thus we can only provide a range of 1954-1962.",

    "name": "Stewart Distilling Co 1898 Pure Rye",
    "description": "A bottling of Stewart Distilling Co pure rye whiskey made in 1898! This was bottled prior to the introduction of prohibition in 1919. Robert Stewart was an Irishman who emigrated to Baltimore in the middle of the 19th century. He started his distillery in 1886 in Highlandtown and then officially incorporated his business in 1894. The firm produced \"Robert Stewart Rye\" and contracted H.B. Kirk in New York for bottling, a firm which also bottled Old Crow Rye from W.A. Gaines & Co. Robert Stewart decided to retire and sell the company in 1897 to the Carstairs of Philadelphia. In 1898, the same year this rye whiskey was produced, a news article claims the distillery had the capacity to produce 1200-1500 gallons of whiskey per day with an expansion planned to up production to 3000 gallons per day. The Carstair Brothers ran the firm themselves from 1898 until 1908 when the firm consolidated its holdings, creating the Stewart Distilling Company and merged its historical Carstairs, Mcall & Co company into one. The distillery and firm operated until 1919. As prohibition loomed the Carstairs Mcall & Co firm chose to liquidate the site, but J.H. Carstair stepped in and purchased the distillery himself. Prohibition hampered any chance of revival however and by 1921 J.H. Carstair was out of the business. The site was sold and continued to hold liquor onsite through the early years of prohibition, even having its liquid stolen by bootleggers in 1923. The moonshiners tunnelled into the distillery from a nearby empty house and pumped the whiskey out of the barrels into containers next door. In 1924 the vice president Jacob Katz of Stewart Distillery and the manager of nearby Sherwood distillery were caught selling both barrels and cases of whiskey, actions outlawed by prohibition. Finally in 1925 the distillery was put up for sale and dismantled, being fully purchased by the Crown Oil & Wax Company in 1927. This specific bottle bears no size or strength, but can be dated to pre-1914 as Carstairs introduced a signature \"non-refillable bottle\" with a unique design. As Stewart Distilling Co is noted on the label this would suggest the bottle is from 1909 or later, thus making this likely an 11-16 year old rye whiskey. ",

    "description": "A circa pre-1916 bottling of J.Wray & Nephew Old Rum bottled prior to the acquisition of the firm by the Lindo Brothers. The history for this bottle is unfortunately quite hard to pin down but the noted firm name of just \"J.Wray & Nephew\" suggests this bottle was completed prior to the 1916 purchase of the firm, with sources suggesting the Lindo Brothers established \"J.Wray & Nephew Ltd\" after finalising the deal. This is somewhat contested as other research material shows this name on a 1916 advertisement of Applemony (a blend of Appleton and Monymusk) but the evidence provided for the bottle suggests this is likely bottled anywhere from the late 1890s until approximately the mid to late 1910s. This will therefore have been blended by C.J Ward, the titular nephew of original founder John Wray. Wray established his rum firm as a blender to supply his pubs, and sourced his rums from the surrounding estates. He brought C.J Ward into the business in 1860 and when Wray died in 1870 he left the entire firm to Ward. This rum is therefore likely a blend of circa early 20th century distillates sourced from the sugarcane estates around Jamaica. These will likely have been from pot stills and will have been crafted long before the ester limit was established for rum by the rum pool in the 1930s. Whilst all effort has been made to ensure historical and era accuracy, this is a supremely rare rum with little to provide more era appropriate dating, please bear this in mind when purchasing. Although no size or Abv is noted on this bottle we expect it is approximately a 750ml sized bottle.",

    "description": "A 1953 bottling of Old Fitzgerald presented in an original glass decanter. Unfortunately the specific dates for this decanter have been lost as a tear at the end of the tax strip means they are missing. Old Fitzgerald was generally aged 8 years or more however, suggesting this was likely distilled in the early to mid 1940s. This glass decanter might seem familiar to Old Fitzgerald enthusiasts, with the shape being replicated by Heaven Hill in their modern Old Fitzgerald releases. This is a classic edition of Stitzel-Weller era produced bourbon that will have been hand crafted with oversight from the original Pappy Van Winkle.",

During the 1990s and early 2000s these warehouses were stuffed full of very mature barrels of Kentucky bourbon and rye amid the industry downturn. The sources of these barrels are typically undeclared, but both Willett & Julian Van Winkle had access to many of the closed 1980s/1990s Kentucky distilleries like Medley, Glenmore, Yellowstone and Stitzel-Weller. They also worked closely with Heaven Hill to contract and purchase very mature barrels. Savvy firms like CVI brands created specialist labels like Black Maple Hill to bottle these mature whiskies as single barrels. Barrel #153 was bottled in the mid 2000s by KBD in Bardstown and is released at 47.5% Abv.",

    "description": "A 1974 vintage expression of pot still produced straight bourbon whiskey from the original Michter's distillery in Pennsylvania. Adolph Hirsch commissioned 400 barrels to be filled by Michter's master distiller Dick Stoll. These barrels were left to mature in Pennsylvania until Michter's shut its doors in the 1980s. The stocks were purchased by liquor legend Gordon Hue, who then contracted Julian Van Winkle to bottle the barrels. A number of different versions of this 400 barrel batch were released, some with wax tops and a hand-full exclusive to the Japanese market. The stocks eventually changed hands, resulting in this gold foil topped edition. This is the bourbon heralded by Chuck Cowdery as \"The best bourbon you'll never try\" in his book. The mythos of the Michter's pot still product has become legend and resulted in this 1974 batch being amongst the most sought after bourbon in Kentucky. ",

During the 1990s and early 2000s these warehouses were stuffed full of very mature barrels of Kentucky bourbon and rye amid the industry downturn. The sources of these barrels are typically undeclared, but both Willett & Julian Van Winkle had access to many of the closed 1980s/1990s Kentucky distilleries like Medley, Glenmore, Yellowstone and Stitzel-Weller. They also worked closely with Heaven Hill to contract and purchase very mature barrels. Savvy firms like CVI brands created specialist labels like Black Maple Hill to bottle these mature whiskies as single barrels. Barrel #300 was bottled in the mid 2000s by KBD in Bardstown and is released at 47.5% Abv.",

Typically bottled at 93 proof, this bourbon is aged in charred American white oak barrels, allowing it to develop a complex character over time. \n\nOn the nose, Blanton's Single Barrel offers inviting aromas of honey, caramel, and ripe fruit, complemented by hints of citrus and spice. The palate is full-bodied and vibrant, featuring flavors of cinnamon, vanilla, and dark chocolate. A subtle spiciness adds depth, while the finish is smooth and lingering, leaving behind notes of oak and sweet toffee.\n\nBlanton's iconic packaging includes a distinctive bottle shape and a horse-and-jockey stopper that has become a collector's item in its own right. With its combination of quality, rarity, and craftsmanship, Blanton's Single Barrel remains a benchmark for bourbon aficionados and continues to capture the hearts of whiskey lovers around the world.\n\n\n",

Well this here is no ordinary spirit, and twenty years is long enough to pick up a trick or two. For one barrel in particular, it was long enough to develop the gift of a silver tongue. The old Stitzel-Weller rickhouse hands had it written off as a rumor. A character so smooth, it could clean out the card sharps and take the shirt off a travelling salesman's back.  But the rumors were true. And when the chips are in, a smooth operator can be mighty persuasive indeed.

    "description": "Nestled in the epicenter of bourbon heritage, Augusta Distillery is a beacon of tradition and community pride. Positioned majestically along the Ohio River, Augusta serves as a gateway to five significant markets, marking its prominence on the famed B-Line Bourbon Trail. The distillery's unwavering dedication to authenticity and heritage shines through in every bottle, encapsulating the very essence of Kentucky's spirit.\n\nThis is the long-awaited follow-up to Buckner’s inaugural offering. The 15-year Single Barrel has matured for a decade and a half to provide an extraordinary pour that leaves a striking first impression, followed by layered complexities on the way to a lingering finish.  Only six barrels were used in this inaugural bottling and barrel #2 offered the lowest yield but the overall best flavor profile.  \n\nColor & Nose - Warm tones of golden copper and candlelight combine with finished cherry wood to draw you near. Active legs confirm this pour is cask strength. With surprising brightness and clarity for its age, the presentation invites further exploration. \n\nPalate - The dry corn and honeyed-vanilla notes from Buckner 13 year have matured into cooked butter and brown sugar on the front with hints of baking spices, clove and weathered cedar that linger. Its symphony of scents suggests a rare complexity only found through the patience of a properly aged 15-year Kentucky bourbon. \n\nFinish - This bourbon’s lingering, perfumed finish may be its defining attribute. Subtle, refined notes of wood, exotic spice, tobacco, and leather endure thanks to time and unfiltered bottling. Like all Buckner’s bourbons, each sip provides an unforgettable experience that instantly returns you to the limestone hills of Kentucky only to demand further unhurried exploration.\n\n ",

This specific bottle was produced in 2003. Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

As soon as you crack that plastic cap, you receive a distinct scent of freshly-picked apples.  After pouring it, the apples continue, but are accompanied by mowed-grass, corn, and a distant mint – simple but pleasant.  On tasting OF1849 was not as smooth as I’d expexted, exploding onto the tongue.  This develops, however into caramel apples, some oak, popcorn, and tres leches cake.  In other words, this is certainly sweet.  The popcorn which develops in the middle adds an interesting contrast to the rest of the swirl.  There’s also quite a nice mouth-feel to it and a spicy-to-clean finish.",

    "name": "Angel's Envy Straight Bourbon Whiskey",
    "description": "Angel's Envy is a pioneering bourbon brand founded in 2010 by legendary Master Distiller Lincoln Henderson and his son Wes Henderson. After Lincoln's retirement from Brown-Forman, where he had developed renowned brands like Woodford Reserve, he came out of retirement to create a whiskey that would challenge traditional bourbon-making techniques.\n\nThe brand's innovative approach centers on secondary barrel finishing, a technique more commonly used in Scotch whisky production. Lincoln and Wes began experimenting with aging bourbon in port wine casks, a method that was initially met with skepticism from bourbon purists. The brand's name originated from Lincoln's joke that while the \"angel's share\" is the portion of whiskey lost to evaporation during aging, the remaining liquid must be what the angels would envy.\n\nIn 2013, Angel's Envy broke ground on its distillery in downtown Louisville, becoming the first full-production whiskey distillery in the city's urban center. This historic location, situated on Whiskey Row, symbolizes the brand's commitment to both innovation and bourbon heritage. The distillery was completed in 2016 and has since expanded, welcoming 10,000 visitors annually.\n\nNow owned by Bacardi, Angel's Envy has grown from a family project to a nationally and internationally distributed brand.

This technique, while more challenging to execute consistently, results in a cleaner, more nuanced spirit that sets it apart from many traditional Kentucky bourbons.\n\nOn the nose, the bourbon offers a complex bouquet of aromas. Rich caramel and vanilla notes mingle with fresh orchard fruits, particularly apple and peach. There's an intriguing undercurrent of baked bread and licorice, adding depth and complexity to the olfactory experience.\n\nThe palate is bold and flavorful, with an initial burst of sweetness from honey and caramel. This is quickly followed by layers of cinnamon, nutmeg, and black pepper spice. The high rye content shines through, providing a pleasant herbal quality and a touch of grassiness. Despite its relative youth, the bourbon displays a surprising fruitiness and depth of flavor.\n\nIt offers a full-bodied mouthfeel with a pleasant warmth that doesn't overwhelm. The finish is long and satisfying, with lingering notes of oak, vanilla, and a subtle hint of dark chocolate.\n\nWilderness Trail Single Barrel Bourbon demonstrates the distillery's expertise in fermentation and distillation, resulting in a whiskey that punches above its age. It offers bourbon enthusiasts a chance to experience a meticulously crafted, unique expression of Kentucky bourbon that balances traditional flavors with innovative production methods.",

    "description": "A circa 1961-1969 era bottling of green Chartreuse as noted by the tax stamp and importer of Schieffelin & Co New York. This firm imported Chartreuse from the 1940s until 1969 and the tax stamp affixed to this bottle was introduced in 1961, thus suggesting this 1961-1969 date range. Older expressions of Chartreuse are highly sought after as the liqueur actively eats sugar, mellowing over time and creating an exceptionally rich and decadent spirit. Chartreuse has been made by French monks for close to two centuries now, with the recipe a close guarded secret. The monks have been forced into exile at various times in the past, moving production to Spain at one point. ",

    "description": "The Wild Turkey Rare Breed from the late 1990s and early 2000s, particularly batches like the renowned W-T-01-99, represents a pinnacle in bourbon craftsmanship that many enthusiasts consider legendary. These expressions, bottled at barrel proof (typically around 108.4 proof), showcase the distillery's commitment to producing complex, full-flavored whiskeys during a time when the bourbon industry was experiencing a glut of aged stocks. This era of Rare Breed is particularly prized for its rich, multifaceted flavor profile that balances intensity with elegance.\n\nTasting notes for these vintage Rare Breed releases often describe a dense, classic Wild Turkey profile with remarkable depth. The nose typically offers a fragrant bouquet of brandy-like fruitiness, honey-maple sweetness, and medicinal cherry, complemented by caramel creme, sweet oak, and herbal-floral spices. On the palate, enthusiasts report an oily mouthfeel delivering waves of cherry-vanilla, butter toffee, and brown sugar, intertwined with sweet herbs, citrus notes, and warm baking spices. The finish is characteristically long and flavorful, leaving a lasting impression of vanilla bean, cola, and molasses. These batches are often cited as being superior to modern releases, showcasing a perfect harmony of aged stocks that's difficult to replicate in today's high-demand bourbon market.\n",

This 12 year old bourbon is bottled at their signature 101 proof and lasted until 1992 when it was changed to a split label. Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

Honey and vanilla on the front palate are met by a mild spice on the mid palate.  Finish: The mid-palate spice carries through the long, luxurious finish.

We can't say where it's from exactly, just that it's from somewhere in the CUribBeAN region. This incredibly complex and fragrant rum combines many of the ester-driven flavors we love about rum from Jamaica and St-Lucia with the richness and elegance of the Spanish style. The flavor profile is drier and more old school in character. There's a big dusty mineral note framed by tropical pineapple, overripe banana and powerful baking spice. On the palate, fresh grassy cane, touches of mint and anise and dried fruit that meanders in between tea and cola. It's a rum you absolutely do not want to miss, especially if you're interested in forbidden fruits.",

Among the Wild Turkey 101 12-year releases of the 1990s, the CGF variety is highly valued when compared to the \"Split Label\" variety from later in the decade. The CGF bottles tend to be valued more highly due to their iconic label and perhaps the quality of the bourbon itself.\n\nIt's described as a fantastic pour with a perfect combination of sweetness and oak.

    "description": "Nose: You can smell the charred oak scent right away. Underneath it is the aroma of musty wood and charred marshmallow. Every scent seems to have a toasted element to it. The vanilla bean scent seems toasted, the toffee seems a little burnt and even the chocolate scent smells a bit scorched. Overall, everything has a very rich and deep scent to it, but in a good way.  Palate: I’m not going to lie, most Heaven Hill whiskies (even lower proofed ones) usually have a roughness about them that may stem from distilling the whiskey to the maximum proof (160) and barreling their whiskey at the maximum barrel proof (125). So I was impressed with the first sip that showed a total lack of harshness (I’m struggling to not use the word “smooth”). Flavors center around loads of char and heavy caramels. Rich vanilla buttercream frosting and some fudge brownie edges with toffee chips also add their weight. Fruits are few and far between with each sip, but I do detect a small amount of cherry cordial flavors. Overall it’s sweet, smoky and very rich.  Finish: Rich, heavy wood flavors dominate on the finish leaving little room for much else to shine through. If anything there may be some cigar box notes followed by a bit of chocolate covered cherries. It feels like every flavor has somehow been condensed even more",

I poured about an ounce in a Glencairn and returned a few minutes later to find the entire room filled with whiffs of bourbon goodness. It’s classic Wild Turkey – with spicy caramel and lots of barrel char leaving a smokey undertone. Mind you, it’s not a peaty whiskey of course, but you can immediately tell the influence of the heavy char levels on the barrels. Its nose is dark and earthy, with spiced wood, and a thick and luscious character.   Palate: The initial sip hits my palate with a blast of spearmint and eucalyptus. The rye influence comes through immediately, but then settles into waves of earthy sweetness. There is a cherry cola or root beer vibe going on with dark cocoa and browned butter sauce. As the sip continues, orange chocolate makes an appearance as does a heavy French vanilla bean note. The mouthfeel is fantastic with a thick and viscous body that coasts the mouth well, leaving a thick earthy, spiced sweetness behind that puckers the side of the cheeks.    Finish: As we move into the finish more of the barrel char from the nose comes through, leading to lovely nutmeg, allspice and clove baking spices on a long and inviting finish. The 101 proof is just enough to make you want to keep going back for more, with that lingering cola note lasting into the next sip. ",

    "description": "Appearances  The bottle of the 151 is one of my favorites from Lost Spirits. It hearkens back to the days of Prohibition with its art deco stylings and tropical travel poster-like imagery. You feel like you may step off of the plane in the picture and end up in La Floradita in Havanna, sitting right next to Papa Hemingway himself.  In the glass, the spirit is a lovely amber color. It’s not very dark like the Plantation Overproof or Lemonhart 151, but it’s got enough color to give it character.  Nose  Fill a glass with the Cuban Inspired and be prepared for it to fill the room. Sitting with a glass of it next to me while putting together my notes, I could smell the rum without ever getting the glass off of the desk.  The rum is rich – so much more than just the burning sensation of ethanol that tortures anyone who generally strays into the robust category of overproof rums. Not to say that there isn’t burn. I wouldn’t recommend sticking your nose deep into a glass and inhaling deeply unless you’re trying to teach your nostrils a lesson. But this is no gasoline.  Notes of cocoa and bananas mingle with the tinge of heat on the nose, bringing to mind desserts like bananas foster. There’s an undercurrent of toasted marshmallow and caramel as well, all before the heat of the spirit brings to mind tall grasses in humid sunshine.  Palate  Let’s get the first thing everyone’s wondering out of the way first: yes, it’s hot. You’re drinking something that’s over 75% alcohol by volume, so if you’re drinking it neat, it’s going to bring some fire for your throat – and lips and tongue and pretty much everywhere else. That being said, one could be forgiven for deciding to drink this poured into a snifter all on its own, or possibly straight out of the bottle.  Before the heat comes, you can taste Bryan’s hard work with entry notes of marshmallow and toffee. The heat from the alcohol is not far behind – don’t gulp this – but after it washes over you you don’t find yourself left with searing pain. Instead, the finish is clean on the tongue, and in the back of the mouth and throat there are elements of candied orange peel and toasted banana.  That’s if you go neat. Of course, with so much heat, most people – if they aren’t mixing – will probably want to throw in an ice cube, and introducing ice to this rum creates impressive change. There’s still a richness, but the tamed heat exposes the oily body of the spirit along with the grassier elements that are hinted at in the flash from rich to hot. Greener notes of straw combine with chocolate and raisins, leaving you with something reminiscent of leather on the finish",

It is bottled at 93 proof (46.5% ABV), the same as the standard Blanton's Single Barrel, ensuring a robust flavor profile.\n\nThe packaging of Takara Red adds to its allure, featuring a distinctive red box with a woven texture and a deep maroon bag that contrasts with the brown bag of domestic Blanton's. The bottle is adorned with a gold-colored wax seal, similar to that found on Blanton's Straight From The Barrel. The label showcases light brown handwritten and printed portions, along with Japanese script spelling out \"Whiskey,\" further emphasizing its exclusivity.\n\nThe Takara Red series is particularly interesting for collectors due to its limited availability and the variations that can arise from individual barrel selections. Some special releases within this series, such as the HBA (Hotel Barmen Association Japan) Single Barrel picks, offer even more unique expressions.\n\nWhile many enthusiasts speculate about the potential superiority of the Takara series due to its rumored longer aging process, recent reviews suggest that modern releases may be more comparable in quality to standard Blanton's. Nevertheless, Takara Red remains a highly coveted expression in the bourbon world, often commanding premium prices on the secondary market.",

At the age of sixteen, he started work in the Distillery as an office boy and fast became a leading pioneer in the development of bourbon. From the time he was made company president in 1921 until his retirement in 1952, his Distillery expanded from 44 to 144 buildings to become the largest Distillery of its day. During that period Colonel Blanton created his very special and limited supply of bourbon - his private reserve - handpicked and stored in what now is known as the famous Warehouse H. Although Colonel Blanton died in the spring of 1959, his legacy lives. Introduced in 1984, Blanton’s namesake bourbon was the first ever Single Barrel Bourbon sold commercially. The Single Barrel Bourbon is the first of its kind.\"",

This 2024 edition showcases a double cask finish, combining American honey barrels and Brazilian Amburana wood to create a truly distinctive flavor profile.\n\nBottled at 98 proof (49% ABV), this straight bourbon whiskey offers a captivating sensory experience. On the nose, it presents enticing aromas of sweet honey, burnt wood, cinnamon potpourri, and cedar, with hints of burnt orange rind and dark fruit. The palate is equally complex, featuring flavors reminiscent of Greek baklava, charred marshmallow, and a harmonious blend of sweet and savory notes.\n\nAs the whiskey develops, it reveals layers of graham cracker, cinnamon stick, cream soda, and roasted malt. The finish is full-bodied and lingering, with a perfect balance of sweetness and spice. Penelope Rio Bourbon manages to improve upon its already popular predecessor, offering bourbon enthusiasts a unique tasting experience that captures the vibrant spirit of Brazil.\n",

Shackleton made an expedition to Antarctic in 1907-1909. The expedition didn’t go well, forcing Shackleton to abandon their hut and leave stuff behind – including the whisky and some Australian brandy made in Hunter Valley. The whisky found from Antarctic was from the Mackinlay’s Rare Old Highland Malt brand, which is nowadays owned by Whyte & Mackay (acquired it as part of Invergordon Distillers in 1995). Mackinlay’s whisky has been discontinued for several years.

    "description": "The Whiskey Baron Collection from Campari is an interesting one. These little 375ml bottles seem to vary drastically in availability price and popularity as well. Slight oak gives way to vanilla but this keeps coming back to big sweet caramel. Right up front is mild vanilla that’s immediately rolled over into a caramel candy. A gorgeous mouthfeel here. A delicate amount of citrus is present–but the buttery caramel and even a bit of dark amber maple syrup mix in as this coats the palate. Does not drink to it’s proof this is an extremely easy-sipper. At 107 proof WB Saffell brings with it a bit of heat that hugs the palate for a nice finish and doesn’t fall away–this is in no way a hot bourbon. There’s a little bit of spice in here but the long voluptuous finish is still holding a sweet note that won’t quit (in a good way).",

    "description": "Since the 1990’s, the Michter’s team has been doing pioneering work to re-establish the high quality American Rye whiskey category. The May 2015 inaugural release of Michter’s US1 Barrel Strength Rye marked yet another milestone in that quest. For maturation, the Rye distillate is entered into the barrel at 103 proof, rather than a more industry standard higher proof. Barrel entry at a lower proof of 103 rather than a higher proof costs Michter’s more money in terms of barrels and warehousing, but we believe it yields a richer, smoother, more full-bodied whiskey after proper maturation.",

The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.\n",

This was distilled in the same year that the large company Norton Simon/Somerset Imports purchased Stitzel-Weller, a company that would change the original mashbill and shift to using a cheaper dry yeast that than the previously used wet jug yeast Pappy preferred. As such it's possible this batch is just within the cutoff to be made with the original mashbill and jug yeast, but no official confirmation was given as to when production changes were made/",

The can contains a bottled in bond pint of pure Canadian rye whiskey and comes complete with a key on the top to pull the metal strip, opening the container. Distillers Corporation Limited notoriously smuggled vast quantities of these tins into the United States, often through French rum smugglers, resulting in Chicken Cock being a particular speakeasy favourite of the 1920s. So much so that the whiskey became the house pour of the notorious Cotton Club in New York, arguably one of history's most famous speakeasies. Chicken Cock changed hands in the later years of prohibition from the Canadian firm, with the American Medicinal Spirits Company now bottling the brand from their existing American produced stocks. AMS became National Distillers after prohibition and attempted to revive the brand before giving up in the 1950s. This sealed tin of pure Canadian rye is a true glimpse into the speakeasy culture of the 1920s and is a genuine time capsule of a long gone era. ",

The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

Commemorating the 100th anniversary of the family estate, Ron Abuelo Centuria offers sweet aromas of oak, vanilla, spice, and dark fruit. Its full-bodied character unfolds with extreme smoothness and sweetness, culminating in a long and luxurious caramel oak finish.  Presented in a substantial wooden case, Ron Abuelo Centuria cradles its precious cargo with elegance and prestige. While the bottle maintains the signature design of the line, the Centuria edition features an engraved wooden top and a prominently raised plastic Varela logo on the front, distinguishing it from its younger counterparts.",

    "description": "Color: Copper gold, slightly hazy.\n\nNose: Nutty Sherry. Freshly made alcoholic toffee or runny caramel used for ice-cream. Toffee backed up by super ripe yellow fruits and still green, starting to become yellow, banana’s. So not really unripe banana’s then. Peaches also come to mind a lot. Dusty. Fresh oak. Well balanced, It may be simple (is it?), yet all these aroma’s go together quite well. Also, it smells like it will taste quite sweet and fruity. We’ll see about that later. Hints of polished furniture. Again fruity and sweet smelling. Cocktail cherries. Diluted red fruit syrup. Sometimes a whiff of a more fresh and minty aroma passes by. Come to think of it, this one does have an aura of old skool Sherried Whisky about it, which I quite like. Hmmm, I also got some old skool in Batch 4. More soft, actually very soft wood and some cardboard. Almost no cask toast, I mention this because there can be a lot of this in Sherried Whiskies. More syrup and now a fresh butter note, adding to the balance, because this is a pleasant smelling Whisky. Sometimes a whiff of sea-air and after some extensive sipping, a more friendly and nice floral detergent note pops up, not a really soapy note, which usually is somewhat more negatively perceived (by me). Yup, nice stuff. Very nice indeed.\n\nTaste: Sweet Sherry and vanilla. Apple pastry, very much so. This surprises me a bit, since I didn’t pick up on apples in the nose (and still don’t). Apple compote. Apple beignets, including the dough. Luckily not to sweet. Nutty and waxy. Some wood in the beginning, but only the more astringent bit of it stays behind on my tongue, the rest of the woody notes are soon overpowered by the vanilla and the toffee ice-cream note, as well as the aforementioned fruit and some freshly baked cookies. After a while the astringent bit I just mentioned, turns into something somewhat bitter. Medium bitterness from wood, as well as from some licorice notes. After some proper tasting, and smelling, this does remind me of old skool (making me feel melancholic) Whisky. In the review of Arran 16yo I mentioned the potential Arran has and that I hope it would someday really show it, well here it is. What a wonderful Arran this turned out to be.",

    "description": "The Wild Turkey 101 \"Split Label\" is a highly regarded expression from the mid-1990s that holds a special place in bourbon history. This 12-year-old bourbon, bottled at 101 proof (50.5% ABV), earned its nickname from its distinctive label design featuring a split between gold and cream colors. Produced during a time when Wild Turkey had access to well-aged stocks, the Split Label represents a transition period between the iconic \"Cheesy Gold Foil\" bottles and more modern releases.\n\nTasting notes for the Split Label often describe a complex and robust flavor profile. The nose typically offers a rich bouquet of caramel, vanilla, and toasted oak, complemented by hints of dried fruit, tobacco, and spices. On the palate, enthusiasts report a full-bodied experience with flavors of butterscotch, maple syrup, dark cherry, and a pronounced spiciness characteristic of Wild Turkey's high-rye mashbill. The finish is long and warming, with lingering notes of oak, vanilla, and a touch of leather. While some collectors argue that the Split Label may not quite reach the legendary status of its Cheesy Gold Foil predecessor, it's still highly sought after for its quality and historical significance, representing a time when age-stated bourbons were more readily available.\n",

    "description": "A 12 year old expression of Wild Turkey bottled at their signature 101 proof strength in 1998. Older editions of Wild Turkey are particularly sought after amongst enthusiasts, notably for their remarkably different taste profile to modern Wild Turkey bottles. The distillery originally produced bourbon using cypress wood tanks but these were slowly phased out from 1984 until 1990. The other notable production change came in 2004 when the barrel entry proof was changed to 110, up from 107. The combination of these changes have resulted in serious demand for older vintage bottlings from the much loved distillery, with some believing 1990s era bottlings to be the distillery’s best ever.",

    "description": "This bourbon, hailing from a line of legendary stocks preserved by Adolf Hirsch, represents an exclusive bottling for Japan. Mr. Hirsch, a prominent figure during the era following the revision of American rail laws, played a vital role in reshaping the American industrial landscape over a 194-year period. Despite facing numerous challenges, he dedicated his efforts to enhancing the quality of this specific product, which had a higher iron content. It was exclusively sourced for the American industry. This Japanese-exclusive bourbon, renowned for its unique flavor profile, was eventually bottled and released, with great anticipation for the recognition it would garner in the future.\n\nThis is the domestic edition of the gold wax 16 year old which is bottled at 45.8% Abv in a 750ml bottle. Both a squat bottle and a tall cognac glass style were released in this age statement and strength.",

    "description": "A 1974 vintage expression of pot still produced straight bourbon whiskey from the original Michter's distillery in Pennsylvania. Adolph Hirsch commissioned 400 barrels to be filled by Michter's master distiller Dick Stoll. These barrels were left to mature in Pennsylvania until Michter's shut its doors in the 1980s. The stocks were purchased by liquor legend Gordon Hue, who then contracted Julian Van Winkle to bottle the barrels. A number of different versions of this 400 barrel batch were released, some with wax tops and a hand-full exclusive to the Japanese market. The stocks eventually changed hands. This is the bourbon heralded by Chuck Cowdery as \"The best bourbon you'll never try\" in his book. The mythos of the Michter's pot still product has become legend and resulted in this 1974 batch being amongst the most sought after bourbon.\n\nThis is the 2003 gold foil release which saw the remaining tanked liquid bottled by Julian Van Winkle at Buffalo Trace. This is also the widest available release and see sizeable exports.",

This single barrel bourbon has its roots in a tradition that began in 1890 when George Garvin Brown, the founder of Old Forester Distillery, gifted a barrel of bourbon to the Governor of Kentucky. The modern version of President's Choice was revived in 1964 by G.G.B. the 2nd, who initially offered it exclusively to presidents and executives of other companies.\n\nToday, President's Choice represents some of the finest barrels from Old Forester, hand-selected for their exceptional quality and unique characteristics. Typically aged between 7 to 12 years, these barrels are bottled at a proof range of 105 to 120, depending on the optimal flavor profile. The expression is released only when barrels exhibit truly remarkable character, making it a limited and highly coveted offering among bourbon enthusiasts.\n\nIn recent years, Old Forester has increased the frequency of President's Choice releases, making this exclusive bourbon more accessible. The brand also offers a President's Choice Tasting Experience at their distillery, allowing visitors to delve into the rich heritage of Old Forester while sampling this sought-after expression.\n\nEach release of President's Choice showcases a unique flavor profile, reflecting the craftsmanship that Old Forester is known for. Tasting notes often include rich caramel, brown sugar, dark fruits, and complex oak flavors, with distinct nuances varying from barrel to barrel.",

Named after William Larue Weller, who is credited with pioneering the use of wheat as a secondary grain in bourbon, this whiskey is part of the prestigious Weller line. Bottled at 90 proof (45% ABV), the bourbon is aged for a full 12 years, offering a rich and complex flavor profile.\n\nThe bourbon features a distinctive wheated mash bill, believed to be approximately 70% corn, 14-16% wheat, and 16-14% malted barley. Its flavor characteristics include notes of caramel, vanilla, dark fruits, and toasted oak, with a smooth and balanced finish. The Weller 12 Year has gained significant popularity among bourbon enthusiasts, often commanding prices well above its suggested retail price due to its reputation and limited availability.\n\nBuffalo Trace carefully selects and ages these barrels, creating a bourbon that showcases the depth and complexity that comes from extended maturation. While the bourbon's proof and age statement are becoming more common in the market, Weller 12 Year continues to be highly sought after by collectors and whiskey lovers alike.\n",

After Lincoln's retirement from Brown-Forman, where he had developed renowned brands like Woodford Reserve, he came out of retirement to create a whiskey that would challenge traditional bourbon-making techniques.\n\nThe brand's innovative approach centers on secondary barrel finishing, a technique more commonly used in Scotch whisky production. Lincoln and Wes began experimenting with aging bourbon in port wine casks, a method that was initially met with skepticism from bourbon purists. The brand's name originated from Lincoln's joke that while the \"angel's share\" is the portion of whiskey lost to evaporation during aging, the remaining liquid must be what the angels would envy.\n\nIn 2013, Angel's Envy broke ground on its distillery in downtown Louisville, becoming the first full-production whiskey distillery in the city's urban center. This historic location, situated on Whiskey Row, symbolizes the brand's commitment to both innovation and bourbon heritage. The distillery was completed in 2016 and has since expanded, welcoming 10,000 visitors annually.\n\nNow owned by Bacardi, Angel's Envy has grown from a family project to a nationally and internationally distributed brand. They continue to push boundaries by experimenting with various finishing techniques, including rum and sherry cask finishes, while maintaining a commitment to quality and craftsmanship passed down through three generations of the Henderson family.\n\nThe Cask Strength series from Angel's Envy is a limited release that aims to add an extra appeal to the already illustrious bourbon brand. Bottled at a higher proof, the Cask Strength line is still finished in Port Wine barrels.",

A number of different versions of this 400 barrel batch were released, some with wax tops and a hand-full exclusive to the Japanese market. The stocks eventually changed hands, resulting in this gold foil topped edition. This is the bourbon heralded by Chuck Cowdery as \"The best bourbon you'll never try\" in his book.

As the only vintage-dated single barrel bourbon on the market, this release offers a unique tasting experience that captures a specific moment in time. Distilled in 2008 and aged for approximately 8 years before bottling in 2016, this bourbon has developed a complex flavor profile during its maturation in American white oak barrels. Bottled at 86.6 proof (43.3% ABV), it strikes a balance between flavor intensity and approachability. On the nose, this vintage likely presents aromas of caramel, vanilla, and oak, complemented by hints of dried fruits and subtle spices. The palate may offer flavors of honey, toasted nuts, and cinnamon, with undertones of leather and tobacco. The finish is expected to be smooth and lingering, with a pleasant warmth and notes of oak and sweet corn. Each bottle of Evan Williams Single Barrel Vintage is marked with the date it was put into oak, the bottling year, and the exact barrel number, allowing enthusiasts to trace the bourbon's journey from grain to glass.

Created by Booker Noe as a tribute to Baker's lifelong dedication to the distillery, the brand has a rich family history deeply rooted in Kentucky bourbon-making tradition.\n\nOriginally introduced as a small batch bourbon, Baker's underwent a significant transformation in recent years, transitioning to a single barrel format. This change was designed to differentiate the brand within Jim Beam's portfolio and provide whiskey enthusiasts with a more unique drinking experience. Each bottle now represents a singular expression, with variations between individual barrels.\n\nPart of the prestigious Small Batch Collection alongside Booker's, Knob Creek, and Basil Hayden's, Baker's occupies a distinctive position in the lineup. The bourbon is typically aged a minimum of seven years, with some expressions reaching up to 13 years. Distilled at the Jim Beam facility in Clermont, Kentucky, Baker's embodies the classic Beam bourbon profile while offering its own distinctive character.\n\nThe brand reflects a commitment to honoring family legacy and bourbon craftsmanship. Each bottle pays homage to the maverick spirit of Baker Beam, who spent 38 years working at the Jim Beam distillery and knew every inch of the facility. This personal connection continues to define Baker's approach to bourbon production, making it more than just a spirit, but a celebration of family and tradition.\n",

Never before have we showcased our inspiring partnership through such absolute innovation and collaborative creativity to bring our worlds together so boldly and definitively.  In its physical form, this is an ingenious object; half Bowmore, half Aston Martin, travelling in two directions at the same time, exploring the ideals of balance, capturing perfect stability combined with definitive intensity.  It is this concept of balance which defines every aspect of ARC-52.  Taking the very same approach to achieving balance and optimal form when designing an Aston Martin, this vessel calls on these exacting principles from the latest 3D printing to hand crafted clay modelling in realising its form.   The cutting-edge engineering of Aston Martin combined with the unfaltering attention to detail and craftsmanship of Bowmore has made ARC-52 a reality.  Bringing these two worlds together has not been without challenge and has seen considerable time invested to realise the vision.  From the meticulously engineered, bespoke magnetic key which releases the striking aluminium top almost by magic, whilst maintaining the sleek, clean lines to the individually, hand blown glass, this is design on a different scale.",

This whisky is notable for its unique maturation process, involving casks made from slow-grown oak trees from the Ozark Mountains in Missouri. These trees are air-seasoned for two years, which is significantly longer than the traditional three to six months. The staves are then toasted, rather than heavily charred, and used to age bourbon before being shipped to Scotland. Glenmorangie fills these bespoke casks with their spirit, allowing it to mature for over five years. The Astar is bottled at cask strength and is known for its rich and complex profile, making it a distinctive offering in the Glenmorangie range.",

Moutai's complex taste and aroma is highly attributed to the unique production process and ingredients which are harvested according to the Lunar calender. Moutai is the most well-known brand of Baijiu in the world. It is considered a luxury item within Chinese culture, with a long and rich history. The liquour is named after the town of Moutai in China where it is exclusively produced (Guizhou province). Much like Champagne or Cognac, Moutai, the spirit, can only be given that name if it is produced in the town of Moutai.",

He would pass away in 1890 and his wife Lida would become the distillery's owner, whereby she persuaded her brother Frank H. Clarke to operate the site. When Lida died in 1911 the distillery passed to her son John Clarke Rogers. He fought valiantly to maintain independence with firms like the Whiskey Trust circling, pressuring small distilleries to join their monopoly or to sell their whiskey exclusively to the trust. Rogers held out but prohibition eventually came looming in 1920 and shuttered the Maysville site.",

A few different releases of Silver Wedding were produced during prohibition, including late 1920s bottlings containing Midway Distilling whiskey bottled by George T. Stagg. When Schenley acquired the Stagg distillery brands such as this came along too. The Fleischman distillery in Ohio was known for its Magnolia branded rye whiskey. The Fleischman firm was one of few to be revived post prohibition. They merged with Royal Baking Powder Company, E. W. Gillett, Widlar Food Products Company, and Chase & Sanborn Coffee Company to create the new firm \"Standard Brands\". This new conglomerate acquired the Davies County/Medley distillery in 1940 from Thomas Medley. The firm would acquire brands like Ezra Brooks and bottle it using Medley produced spirit. Fleischman had ultimately been dissolved into the wider Standard Brands portfolio and in 1980 they sold their distilling interests to Glenmore as the larger firm merged with Nabisco in 1981. ",

Our Limited Release Rum & PX Sherry is a classic reimagined.\n\nThe bulk of the marriage is made up of bright and juicy ex-bourbon cask matured Whisky with a smattering of ex-Sherry and White Oak casks which serve to fuse this bright spark of a marriage with the heavy, sweet notes of the Rum and PX Sherry.\n\nThe Whisky was initially matured for between 5.5 and 7 years in 100 and 200L casks, then finished in ex-Seppeltfield PX Sherry and ex-Lark Quiet Cannon Rum casks for 3 months.",

This single pot still whiskey represents the pinnacle of Irish whiskey craftsmanship and is highly regarded as one of the best in Midleton's range.\n\nThe whiskey is crafted using a blend of pot still spirits from light, medium, and heavy styles, showcasing the versatility and complexity of the single pot still category. It is primarily matured in first-fill bourbon casks, with a small portion aged in virgin American oak barrels, imparting a unique flavor profile.\n\nOn the nose, it offers soft and delicate aromas of acacia honey, white flowers, and baked bread, complemented by subtle notes of caramel toffee. The palate is remarkably complex, presenting a harmonious blend of citrus fruits, mixed peel, toffee, cocoa, honey, and Belgian waffles. There are also intriguing hints of engine oil and marshmallow, creating a truly multifaceted tasting experience.\n\nWhen reduced with water, the whiskey reveals even more delicate aromas and additional fruity notes. The palate becomes softer and more polished, with new flavors of boiled sweets, pear drops, kiwi fruit, and melon emerging.\n\nBottled at 46% ABV, this non-chill filtered whiskey offers a smooth, light, and soft finish that lingers pleasantly. The Barry Crockett Legacy has garnered numerous accolades, including Gold Medals at the Irish Whiskey Awards and Master awards at the Irish Whiskey Masters.\n\nThis limited edition release exemplifies the art of Irish whiskey-making and serves as a fitting tribute to Barry Crockett's enduring legacy in the world of fine spirits.\n\n",
